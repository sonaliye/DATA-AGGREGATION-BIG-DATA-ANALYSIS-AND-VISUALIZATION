AMSheikh Yusuf EstesFri PMSheikh Yusuf EstesSat PMSheikh Assim Al HakeemSun AMThis website has 
been specially designed for the people affected by Fibromyalgia Chronic pain Asperger ADHD Anxiety It 
provides the latest research articles CBD Oil TreatmentsMention legalizing medical marijuana and 
people often think two things As it turns out neither has proven to be true according to new research 
Since medical marijuana first became legal in California in it been legalized across nearly three fifths of 
the United States However that had virtually no impact on the rate of recreational marijuana use among 
teens broad review of published studies has found Several years ago before the group of papers we 
analyzed started to be published people thought that medical marijuana laws would increase teen 
marijuana use by sending the message to teens that marijuana was safe and acceptable to use explained 
Deborah Hasin the new study lead author However she said it doesn seem that teens were impacted 
much by this perhaps because they didn find the legalization of medical use very relevant to them or 
didn even know about the laws Hasin is professor of epidemiology at Columbia University College of 
Physicians and Surgeons in New York City The impact of marijuana legalization also has been minimal on 
the risk for fatal overdosing among adult users of opioid pain medications separate study team has 
found On the opioid link American Australian and British researchers found little to suggest that 
increased access to medical marijuana as an alternative way to manage chronic pain has led to any 
measurable drop in deaths from opioid abuse In fact lead author Wayne Hall warned that research 
suggesting any substantive link between the two is weak He is professor with the Center for Youth 
Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland in Brisbane Australia Hall and his colleagues 
caution that it is premature to recommend the expansion of access to medical cannabis as policy to 
reduce opioid overdose risks in the United States and Canada Though the chances of overdosing on 
marijuana are low the drug has been shown to have only modest effect for pain control according to the 
researchers There are much better treatments than marijuana that have been shown to reduce opioid 
overdose deaths that are not currently being widely used in the Hall said Foremost among these is 
medication assisted treatment using methadone or buprenorphine Despite the findings of both research 
teams legalizing medical marijuana is not consequence free Hasin said Passing laws legalizing marijuana 
use has some social benefits business and tax revenues job creation and reduction in unfair race based 
arrests she said And while not every marijuana user experiences harms using marijuana does have some 
risks including withdrawal addiction and increased chances of vehicle crashes Hasin said The results of 
both studies are published online Feb in the journal Addiction Paul Armentano deputy director of

results of the finding regarding use among youth Dozens of studies he said affirm that regulating either 
adult marijuana use or medical purposes is not associated with any significant uptick in either youth use 
access problematic use or drug treatment admissions The data is clear and consistent on these issues 
and those opining to the contrary are either willfully ignorant or woefully ignorant of the relevant

beNiemand anders dan de stervenden weten beter hoe je gelukkig kan leven zonder spijt Palliatief 
verpleegkundigen Christine De Coninck en Ann Brusseel luisterden naar hun verhaal We hebben 
allemaal wel een zogenaamde bucket list de dingen die we nog willen doen voor we komen te gaan 
Maar willen we cht nog een parachutesprong ondernemen of een boek schrijven of de wereld afreizen 
als we weten dat we niet erg lang meer te leven hebben In Wat de levenden kunnen leren van de 
stervenden vertellen twee verpleegkundigen uit de palliatieve zorg van het UZ Gent Christine De 
Coninck en Ann Brusseel over wat er omgaat bij de pati nten die weten dat ze het ziekenhuis niet levend 
zullen verlaten En dat zijn geen snelle to do lijstjes met spectaculaire stunts en wereldreizen Christine en 
Ann begeleidden doorheen de jaren honderden mensen jong en oud arm en rijk in hun laatste weken en 
uren naar de onvermijdelijke dood Met velen van de stervenden voerden zij voor hun boek intense 
gesprekken over wroeging en teleurstelling maar ook over vreugde en berusting over dingen afmaken 
en loslaten over verder leven in je geliefden over het mooie eren over blijven geloven plezier maken en 
genieten geen spijt hebben he gevoelens uitspreken en vooral niet bang zijn om te sterven Onze huidige 
maatschappij is meer dan ooit op rentabiliteit gericht op effici nt zijn zo schrijven Christine en Ann We 
vergeten soms hoe belangrijk het is om er gewoon nog te zijn En heel dikwijls zeggen we tegen de pati 
nt dat hij of zij nog veel kan betekenen voor zijn of haar familie Ze hebben misschien nog belangrijke 
boodschappen te geven nog zaken aan te leren aldus de auteurs Zo beschrijven ze de terminale Wouter 
een jarige ingenieur en vader van drie kinderen die voor zijn dood nog een kookboekje schreef omdat hij 
als fijnproever en levensgenieter tijdens zijn leven nog een beetje verder wou leven na zijn dood De 
belangrijkste levensles die we volgens de auteurs kunnen leren van de stervenden is genieten van het 
leven en plezier maken Of zoals zovelen op hun sterfbed zeggen Had ik maar niet zo hard gewerkt 
Genieten Vlamingen blijven het er moeilijk mee hebben Mensen denken veel te vaak aan presteren of 
aan het plannen van zaken die nog dienen te gebeuren en hebben het afgeleerd om bewust stil te staan 
bij heel gewone dingen die je gelukkig zouden kunnen maken Sommige mensen hebben te weinig echt 
geprofiteerd van het leven en nemen zichzelf dit kwalijk als ze stervend zijn We voelen vaak gevoelens 
van spijt bij de stervenden Had ik mijzelf maar wat meer geluk gegund tijdens mij leven horen we dan 
De verpleegkundigen raden dan ook aan om niet van vakantie tot vakantie te leven maar gelukkig te zijn 
op een gewone dag Dat beseffen we vaak pas als we bijna dood zijn Ook deze goede raad lijken de 
levenden vaak nog te vergeten Hoe vaak zeggen mensen niet Als ik ooit in een comateuze toestand 
geraak maak dan maar een einde aan mijn leven en laat me niet verder leven als een plant Maar we 
kunnen het niet genoeg herhalen als je die wens niet op schrift stelt bij wijze van een voorafgaande 
wilsbeschikking zoals euthanasie dan kan de euthanasie of levensbe indiging niet gevraagd worden En 
als je het zelf niet meer kan zeggen dan is het te laat Christine en Ann beschrijven in hun boek ook hoe 
ze steeds meer ontroerd raken als ze mensen zien sterven Dan zie je voel je soms het moment dat de 
geest uit het lichaam gaat zo klinkt het Ja wij zijn heel nuchter en geloven niet in paranormale zaken 
maar soms el je dat de geest het lichaam verlaat Zo was er de jonge vrouw die zichzelf in een 
zelfmoordpoging in brand had gestoken een ex fotomodel Ze lag helemaal ingepakt ze had de 
gruwelijkste brandwonden dus we konden niet zien hoe ze eruitzag Bij het sterven hadden we het 
gevoel dat ze uit haar lichaam trad Plots zagen we in haar mooie gezicht hoe ze echt was terwijl we haar 
daarvoor nooit gezien hadden Dat was heel eng aldus de dames Een ding staat vast We gaan allemaal 
sterven maar als het zover is zijn we allemaal beginnelingen De angst om te sterven zal er altijd zijn 
omdat we onvoorbereid zijn besluiten Christine en Ann Wat de levenden kunnen leren van de 
stervenden is uitgegeven bij Borgerhoff Lamberigts ISBNVlaamse psychiaters slaan alarm Mensen plegen 
zelfmoord omdat ze niet de juiste zorg krijgenMis niet langer het belangrijkste nieuws van de dag Schrijf

Warriors and Tularosa Wildcats battled on the hard court Jan Photo Courtesy Taylor Huey pair of 
scrappy basketball matches were played at Ruidoso High School as the Warriors and Lady Warriors faced 
long time rival Tularosa on Jan with both teams falling to the Wildcats Dennise Martinez takes the ball to 
the hoop Photo Courtesy Taylor Huey GirlsThe Lady Wildcats came away with the win leaving final score 
on the board of The Lady Warriors and the Lady Wildcats took to the floor at equal speeds From the tip 
off it was clear that the game was going to be exciting We honestly didn play bad game Tularosa is 
juggernaut They are who they are For the most part think we played well but we haven been 
rebounding well and we ve been missing lot of layups Ruidoso Lia Mosher was fortunate to gain 
possession of the ball to begin the match as she easily swiped the initial jump ball An asset in the 
following play as well Mosher scored an easy backboard bucket to give Ruidoso the lead in the first 
moments of competition Mosher found number of ways to shine in the remainder of the match as she 
lead the team with points In no way were the Lady Wildcats put off by the game beginning as they 
began an effective half court trap from the game beginning causing the Lady Warriors to have trouble 
with countless turnovers The Lady Warriors did their best to find an offensive opening with little payoff 
Tularosa young ladies were able to make number of easy lay ups off of their press led by Cassie Vickery 
who had points at the end of the match The Lady Warriors in an attempt to slow the on the block 
success of Tularosa pulled into tight zone defense keeping the Lady Wildcats at bay and forcing them to 
shoot more challenging shots from outside the three point line At the end of the first quarter the 
Ruidoso Lady Warriors found themselves down by seven points Going into the second quarter the Lady 
Wildcats showed no signs of slowing their aggressive play as they transitioned to high pressure full court 
press With on the clock in the second with the Lady Warriors still trailing the Lady Wildcats Ruidoso 
Hailey Evans made pace changing layup that caused the young ladies to come as close as they would to 
the Lady Wildcats score as they would all night down by mere five buckets At the halfway mark the Lady 
Wildcats lead the Lady Warriors by points putting the score board in their favor to After the half the rest 
of the game proceeded in similar manner Unfortunate turnovers by the Lady Warriors put them at 
disadvantage as the Lady Wildcats hit them hard in their weakness of young team with few ball handlers 
In the fourth quarter Tularosa began an offensive stall keeping the Lady Warriors within at least points 
to finish the game Ruidoso saw more action on the road against Hatch Valley High School Tuesday and 
will return home to play Lovington High School at Saturday BoysFollowing the play by the women the 
Warriors and Wildcats hit the hardwood for more action Both teams showed that it would be an 
aggressive and fast paced game as they flew up and down the court But Tularosa held on for the victory 
The Ruidoso Warriors maintained close defensive stance as they began man to man defense to start the 
match It was hard fought game Ruidoso girls basketball coach Billy Page said Tularosa is always tough 
We got down by too much to overcome the deficit Even with that Page said he was proud of the way the 
team fought until the end of the game Even without the team record the Warriors have hit their share 
of bumps in the road since Christmas break after losing five players to disciplinary or academic issues 
We ve been through little bit of transition Page said about the loss But think the team now is coming 
together He said the key to turning around the season will be developing trust in each other and the 
program There is no rest for the Warriors this week The team hosted Hatch Valley Tuesday and will hit 
the road Friday to meet Cobre at in Bayard They then return home to play Bosque High School following 
the girls game around Saturday Jonathan Lewis takes the ball down the court Photo Courtesy Taylor

viewEver since the Elmore Sports Group initiated one of the biggest overhauls in Minor League Baseball 
three teams traded places The AAA Colorado Springs SkySox moved to San Antonio to become the 
Missions The AA San Antonio Missions moved to Amarillo to become the Sod Poodles and the Helena 
Brewers Advanced Rookie has replaced the SkySox For the time being the SkySox moniker was kept up 
but it wasn secret the team would rebrand And that is what happened today Today the Colorado Springs 
Pioneer League affiliate presented its new name and logos From now on the club will be named Rocky 
Mountain Vibes We were truly inspired by all of the submissions that we received and we re thrilled to 
bring the Rocky Mountain Vibes brand to life said President and General Manager Chris Phillips We are 
looking forward to the season and beyond and making Vibes Baseball an integral part of the Colorado 
Springs community The colors of the club are inspired by the state flag of Colorado part of that flag is 
incorporated in the logo as the of the Rocky Mountain name is the of the Coloradoan flag The primary 
logo features the team name Vibes in fiery font resting on marshmallow roasting stick The other logos 
pull inspiration from the same fiery font and marshmallow theme The flaming CS logo features 
marshmallow with bite taken out to form on roasting stick with the on fire Another logo features the 
Colorado on flaming marshmallow while the final logo features vibing mallow with sunglasses graham 
cracker vest sunglasses hiking boots and flaming hair while flashing the new Vibes with his right hand In 
general it is not hard to figure out what the link between the town area team is located at and the name 
is But in this case one may scratch one head What on earth is the link between Colorado Springs the 
Rocky Mountains and the name Vibe The club started name the team contest in July and the following 
names were the five finalists Happy Campers Lamb Chops Punchy Pikas Throttle Jockeys and Rocky 
Mountain Oysters Strange enough none of the aforementioned names were picked The name is an 
offshoot of brainstorming sessions related to the proposed Happy Campers moniker Thinking about that 
the logo isn all that strange Roasting marshmallows is one of the things you can do when sitting around 
campfireAccording to Benjamin Hill of milb com Colorado is super transient state so many people are 
from somewhere else said Vibes general manager Chris Phillips You hear things like When moved here 
was such happy camper It not so much about camping as it is state of mind The people who live out here 
whether they re camping or hiking with their family or walking the dog or having beer with buddy they 
re happy campers But what makes the people here happy campers he continued It the outdoors the 
sunshine that feeling you get when you live here in Colorado So what that feeling How do you describe 
that And thus name was born It those Rocky Mountain Vibes The logos are nice nothing wrong with that 
They were designed by Brandiose from San Diego Once again Brandiose has stepped away from its main 
type of design In the recent past one could clearly tell logo was made by Brandiose In the past weeks we 
had two logo presentations the Sod Poodles and Trash Pandas and in both cases the design was not 
typical Brandiose and so is this one The club will sport four caps One home road cap and four alternates 
The home road cap will sport smore flaming marshmallow between two cookies Two of these alternates 
sport the flaming CS Colorado Springs logo One all navy and one navy with grey front The fourth 
alternate cap will be navy one with beige lid and button The logo on that cap is the burning 
marshmallow on stick The caps are on pre sale The shipping will start on December nd Fill in your details

Becoming repeat champion in any sport is tough and the St Cloud Sluggers have their shot at it when 
they head to state this weekend The Sluggers are an adapted softball team made up of kids from St 
Cloud Sauk Rapids and Sartell They went in the regular season earning themselves the top seed heading 
into the state tournament The last adapted softball team to repeat as state champs were Anoka 
Hennepin in Michael Bakken is the team head coach He says they re not too worried about offense this 
weekend We have people on our team that are for batting another in the and three in the So our batting 
is good we just have to play defense Bakken says they re just trying to stay focused as they head into the 
tournament We re just trying to stay focused work on our fielding We feel if we can field and not make

Coon Rapids High SchoolHTTP Error The request URL is invalidWeek of the NFL season was filled with 
important games potential Super Bowl preview didn disappoint and the playoff picture began to take 
shape in both conferences Here recap of this week action Anderson carried times for yards and the 
Broncos beat the Chiefs on Sunday night Denver scored points in the first half and never allowed Kansas 
City to seriously threaten in the second half Broncos QB Peyton Manning had light night just passing 
yards and two scores but the Chiefs defense was unable to contain Anderson who caught TD pass and 
helped set up five Connor Barth field goals Anderson also ran for yards in win over Miami last week 
Adding his running game to Manning aerial assault could make Denver an even bigger post season 
threat The victory put the Broncos one game up on San Diego and two games up on KC in the AFC West 
race Aaron Rodgers threw for yards and two touchdowns including one to the un defensible Jordy 
Nelson and the Green Bay Packers edged the New England Patriots at Lambeau Field on Sunday in duel 
of potential Super Bowl contenders Winners of eight of nine games Green Bay remained undefeated at 
home this season and stayed game ahead of the Lions in the NFC North The Packers went up in the 
second quarter when Rodgers connected with Nelson on yard score with seconds left before halftime 
New England pulled within on Tom Brady second touchdown pass of the game early in the fourth 
quarter but the Patriots could not complete the comeback For all the talk of this game being Super Bowl 
preview the NFL would love rematch of this contest in Arizona this February Aided by controversial late 
pass interference call the Chargers beat the Ravens giving Baltimore its first home loss in November 
since San Diego trailed the entire game before rallying with three fourth quarter touchdowns including 
Philip Rivers yard pass to Eddie Royal with seconds to play Officials tagged Ravens defensive back 
Anthony Levine with pass interference penalty with seconds left setting up Rivers game winning toss to 
Royal play later Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh questioned the call but his team defense had no 
answers for Rivers who went for for yards and three touchdowns on Sunday Both teams stayed in the 
middle of the muddled AFC playoff chase but the Chargers moved in to second place in the AFC West 
after the Chiefs lost to the Broncos on Sunday night If you think that Week seems like bad time for 
quarterback controversy you don know Johnny Football After Browns QB Brian Hoyer was ineffective for 
the third straight game rookie Johnny Manziel stepped in and went for passing for yards He also scored 
on yard run The Bills still beat the Browns but Manziel did enough to create uncertainty as to which QB 
should be under center for Cleveland for the rest of the season Given Manziel penchant for dramatic 
play it could be perfect timing Buffalo stayed alive in the AFC playoff mix which includes the Browns and 
eight other teams within two games of each other The Bills don have QB quandry but give Kyle Orton 
some time He threw two interceptions before playing just well enough to not lose the game for his team 
this time Just when the NFC South seemed like lock to crown champion with losses New Orleans and 
Atlanta stepped up and won on Sunday Drew Brees threw five touchdowns as the Saints topped the 
Steelers and the Falcons beat the Cardinals behind Julio Jones catches for yards and score New Orleans 
ended its three game losing streak and stayed tied for the NFC South lead Despite QB Ben 
Roethlisberger yards passing and two touchdowns Pittsburgh fell game and half behind Cincinnati in the 
AFC North Atlanta knocked off fellow division leader Arizona which is now ahead of Seattle by just one 
game in the NFC West The Falcons offense has been very good at settling for field goals lately Matt 
Bryant had five on Sunday but it will need more than that with Green Bay Pittsburgh and New Orleans

Laird StadiumNORTHFIELD Minn The Carleton College football team rang in the campaign in style as they 
scored points off turnovers and racked up yards of offense en route to win over the Grinnell College 
Pioneers Quarterback Conor Lynch Sr Salem Ore South Salem completed of passes for yards and three 
touchdowns His favorite target of the game Anthony Kemper Sr Prior Lake Minn Prior Lake caught eight 
balls for yards and two scores thought it was good win for us said Carleton head coach Bob Pagel We did 
some really good things out there Almost everyone got chance to play and contribute The boys played 
hard together and got great win for us The Knights got things going early when on Grinnell second 
possession of the game safety Dan Cook Jr Inver Grove Heights Minn South St Paul read quarterback 
Sam Poulos eyes and snagged an interception at the Pioneer yard line Carleton capitalized immediately 
on the good field position On the first play after the turnover Lynch heaved yard bomb that Kemper 
hauled in before diving into the endzone to put the Knights up with to go in the first quarter Grinnell 
responded with good return and yard drive to bring them to Carleton yard line Faced with fourth and 
one the Pioneers elected to go for it but were stymied by the Knights defensive line as Jonathan Rowe Sr 
St Cloud Minn Cathedral wrapped up Polous for the first of his sacks The Pioneers next threatening drive 
came in the second quarter when they drove down to the Knights yard line On rd and Poulos scrambled 
forward where linebacker Zach Heinrich Jr Champlin Minn Champlin Park knocked the ball loose Jake 
Boerma Fy Watertown Watertown recovered the fumble On Carleton ensuing drive Lynch threw screen 
pass to Chris Madden Fy Kenosha Wis St Joseph and the rookie scrambled yards down the right sideline 
spinning out of tackles and following his blockers all the way into the endzone to lift the Knights to lead 
The Knights got chance to test out their two minute offense late in the half Taking the ball with until 
halftime Lynch led Carleton on six play yard drive that was capped by yard touchdown pass to Kemper 
allowing Carleton to carry advantage into the break The Knight defense came up with four turnovers on 
the day including pair deep in Carleton territory In the third quarter Rowe recovered fumble on the one 
yard line and later in the fourth Josh Estes Sr Chicago Ill Walter Payton stepped in front of Poulos pass at 
similar spot Following the final turnover backup quarterback Zach Creighton Fy Lakeville Minn Lakeville 
North took the offense for spin rattling off nine play yard drive that ended when he delivered yard 
touchdown pass to Brian Frett Sr Wilmette Ill New Trier increasing Carleton lead to with only remaining 
in the contest Turnovers were huge said Pagel They had some momentum going but the turnovers were 
timely and we were very fortunate to get those Poulos and the Pioneers finally found the endzone with 
seconds remaining in the contest to make the final score In addition to the air attack Carleton also 
benefitted from sturdy ground performance from John Baker Sr Minneapolis Minn Breck who carried 
the ball times to the tune of career best yards averaging yards per carry The guys up front did great job 
wearing down Grinnel defensive line and helped us establish run game which was critical to our success 
said Pagel Several players had showcase games for the Knight defense including Luke Reppe Jr 
Northfield Minn Northfield who led the squad with tackles while Estes added to his interception Poulos 
finished of for yards with two interceptions and the touchdown Jacob Meixler led the receiving Pioneers 
corps snagging passes for yards Carleton heads into its bye week but returns to the gridiron on Saturday

Whisenhunt wasn happy with his players immediately after loss to the ers on Monday night But he didn 
take it out on them in their first practice after the defeat Whisenhunt in fact backed off The Cardinals 
practiced without pads or helmets for about two hours on Wednesday We re just little over hours from 
the game Whisenhunt said Guys are still pretty sore We re trying to get some guys back The Cardinals 
installed the game plan for Sunday game against the Packers The practice was more of an extended walk 
through than anything else so the team injury situation remains unclear Quarterback Kevin Kolb ribs and 
right guard Adam Snyder quadriceps did not practice Kolb has been doing some light throwing but doesn 
appear close to being ready to play Tight end Todd Heap knee was limited and remains question mark 
He hasn played since suffering the injury in the second week of the season Cornerback Greg Toler 
hamstring practiced for the first time since suffering the injury against the Rams on Oct Toler was 
limited In Green Bay the Cardinals have an opponent with almost as many injured players as they do 
Receiver Greg Jennings groin abdomen and cornerback Charles Woodson collarbone are out Six other 
players missed practice on Wednesday fullback John Kuhn hamstring defensive end Mike Neal ankle 
receiver Jordy Nelson hamstring linebacker Nick Perry knee wrist cornerback Sam Shields ankle and 
defensive end Jerel Worthy concussion Nelson Kuhn Perry and Shields are starters Well we ve had to 
deal with lot of that up here in Green Bay over my five years starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers said It 
next man up mentality but it an expectation that the coaches put on the players and the players put on 
each other The Cardinals past two opponents the Vikings and ers played conservatively on defense They 
kept their safeties deep to take away big plays reasoning that the Cardinals couldn put together enough 
long drives to win They were right But that not the Packers style said quarterback John Skelton This 
defense is little like our defense actually Skelton said in that they bring lot of different looks lot of 
different blitzes So we ve just got to be prepared for whatever they end up putting out there Running 
back Beanie Wells is running well and is on target to return to practice next week Wells was placed on 
the injured designated to return list after suffering torn ligament near his toe against the Eagles in week 
three He is eligible to practice next week and return to game action on Nov against the Rams There no 
question he makes difference in the run game because of his size speed combo and that would help us

charges after being accused of running high stakes card games at his house in Tallahassee Fla The six 
member jury deliberated less than two hours before rejecting two days of prosecution testimony nearly 
all of which failed to prove Fuller gambled or took percentage of the pot want to thank God the person 
that controls my life Fuller said said from the word go that was innocent This turned out to be bunch of 
mess The charges carried possible five year prison sentence and fine An undercover agent the 
prosecution strongest witness testified he saw hundreds of dollars being wagered at Fuller home but 
failed to place Fuller at the table One other witness did say she saw Fuller playing game called Georgia 
Skins but could not say how much he won or lost and also said she felt pressured by law enforcement 
when she gave her original statement Florida state law allows players to gamble up to hand Three other 
witnesses who were in the house the night of the raid testified that there was not any gambling going 
on contradicting earlier statements made to authorities The prosecution rested its case Friday night and 
both sides made closing arguments yesterday My name has always been clear Fuller said People know 
the things that do the community service not going to get caught up in the emotion of it They tried to 
make me into something that wasn just because of the place grew up If grow up in low income housing 
most of my friends are going to be there Authorities raided Fuller home in April having surveyed the 
residence for months after an attempted robbery and shootout at the place in January No one was 
injured The event triggered the investigation among the Tallahassee Police Department Leon County 
Sheriff Office and Florida Department of Law Enforcements which provided the undercover agent 
Investigators found in bills at the time of the raid but Leon County sheriff deputy testified that money 
could have come from the bank The prosecution failed to prove Fuller either kept gambling house felony 
or gambled illegally misdemeanor The verdict on the felony count automatically cleared him of related 
weapons charge Prosecutors accused Fuller of carrying gun during the card games to ensure that he 
would get the house cut most of which they claimed was put in shoe box on the game room floor The 
Ravens have stood by Fuller since the beginning and continued to offer support after hearing of their 
player innocence Nickel back Deion Sanders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Derrick Brooks made 
appearances in the courtroom It great news for Corey said Kevin Byrne Ravens senior vice president of 
public and community relations He stated from the beginning he was innocent Unfortunately he had to 
go through this process to prove it We know he good man Fuller has played the past two seasons with 
the Ravens and is under contract next year The Associated Press contributed to this articleThere no 
truth to the rumor Chris Chelios threw out the first pitch in the World Series the last time professional 
franchises in the cities of Pittsburgh and Detroit squared off in postseason series But at the defenseman 
represents the old guard Detroit Red Wings as they prepare to take on year old Sidney Crosby and the 
Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup finals There are Red Wings with their names engraved on the 
Stanley Cup while three Penguins appear on the legendary trophy an indication experience is on Detroit 
side The Red Wings reeled off franchise record nine straight playoff victories before losing twice to 
Dallas in the Western Conference finals But the Penguins are hot with mark this postseason including 
perfect record on home ice Here breakdown of the series DEFENSEAs strong as the Penguins are 
offensively the Wings are equally adept along the blue line Nicklas Lidstrom right who has captured the 
Norris Trophy as the league best defender five of the last six seasons and Brian Rafalski are combined 
plus in the playoffs Chelios doesn play as much or score as much as he used to but is still strong on the 
puck and Niklas Kronwall is solid Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk are finalists for the Selke Trophy 
given to the NHL best defensive forward and will be big help in shutting down the Penguins Big Three 
For Pittsburgh Sergei Gonchar is one of the league top defenders and has goal and assists while Ryan 
Whitney and Rob Scuderi are each plus EDGE RED WINGSGOALTENDINGMarc Andre Fleury of the 
Penguins and the Wings Chris Osgood have elevated their games in the postseason Fleury is with goals 
against average and save percentage along with three shutouts Osgood is with goals against average 
and save percentage The Wings have veteran Dominik Hasek waiting in the Wings if Osgood somehow 
should falter EDGE EVENCOACHINGDetroit Mike Babcock has taken team to the Stanley Cup finals 
previously guiding Anaheim in where it fell to New Jersey in seven games Penguins coach Michel 
Therrien captured the Memorial Cup in given to the champion of the Canadian Hockey League Coaching 
at home is bonus and the Wings have home ice advantage EDGE RED WINGSFORWARDSThe Penguins 
are the most dangerous offensive team in hockey with the trio of Sidney Crosby left postseason points 
including league high assists Marian Hossa and Evgeni Malkin who each have nine goals and assists 
Throw in Jordan Staal who had only regular season goals but has six in the playoffs and Ryan Malone 
points and the offense has been explosive Nearly as impressive is the Red Wings front line attack In 
games Zetterberg has points is plus and wins face offs at rate of percent Datsyuk has points and is plus 
while Johan Franzen has points The key here is Franzen who has missed the last five games with 
concussion like symptoms The Red Wings have been mum on his status for the finals but if he can return 
Tomas Holmstrom three goals seven assists and Jiri Hudler points must step up EDGE PENGUINSCHRIS 
KUC PICKDefense and goaltending win Stanley Cups RED WINGS IN SEVENHad he been there Joseph 
Floyd Vaughan might have chuckled at the irony For more than three decades baseball Hall of Fame was 
an exclusive country club for which the man they called Arky simply couldn gain membership He didn 
know the right people Finally years after he drowned in crater of an inactive volcano known as Lost Lake 
the doors to Cooperstown were opened to him Arky Vaughan Hall of Famer Imagine that What some 
considered one of Cooperstown chief injustices an oversight of major league proportions had been 
righted In recognition of this memorable event the Hall of Fame put out commemorative envelopes 
bearing Arky likeness and career statistics The same was done for all of the inductees during the Hall 
induction weekend The envelopes were available at the Cooperstown souvenir store Above the

Dodgers were the words Arky Vaughn Yep The Hall misspelled Arky last name In way it figured 
Fame and Arky had an understanding If their paths ever crossed well that was OK with him But Arky 
wasn about to go looking for it So it seemed only logical that when the two finally met head on earlier 
this month when Arky was officially became famous there would be something awkward about the 
encounter Four days after his death on Aug the Fullerton Daily News Tribune which had chronicled his 
eventful career at Fullerton High School mourned the loss of its famous former resident and told of his 
aversion to recognition The words were written in column called The Town Crier He lacked only one 
thing colorful personality Those who knew him best believe he would have been one of the game 
greatest heroes had he been endowed with the sparkling personality that made lesser players great 
Some speculate that his soft spoken ways were the reason it took so long for Vaughan to gain entrance 
to Cooperstown But flamboyance just wasn Arky style No his daughter Patricia Johnson said In fact he 
didn approve of that He didn like showboats at all Said Bob Vaughan Arky younger brother Sitting and 
talking in one to one situation he was great He just didn care for crowds And he would probably avoid 
an interview if he could He would just rather let his playing do the talking Even then fame found way to 
keep its distance In the All Star game Arky hit pair of two run home runs the second of which gave the 
National League lead But when you think of the All Star game you think of Ted Williams dancing around 
the bases in celebration of ninth inning three run homer that gave the American League victory You don 
remember Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop who became the first player ever to hit two homers in an All Star 
game Red Smith the late New York sports columnist once described Arky as baseball most superbly 
forgotten man Perhaps he had only himself to blame But it just wasn Arky way to go around reminding 
people about Arky It like said when Arky was inducted to the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame in Bob 
Vaughan recalled If Arky would have been there he would have said Thank You And that would have 
been it But he have meant it GREAT Truly Floyd Arky Vaughan was one of the greatest athletes ever 
produced in Fullerton Only one other Walter Johnson achieved the success he did He was born Floyd 
Ellis Vaughan in Clifty Ark on March The name change came during his playing days with Pittsburgh 
when he decided to convert to Catholicism The nickname was natural The Vaughan family moved from 
Arkansas to Potter Valley small farm town in Mendocino County when Arky was an infant When Arky 
father was hired by Standard Oil he relocated to Fullerton where Arky began storied athletic career 
former football teammate of Arky at Fullerton wrote letter to daughter Patricia after the induction 
ceremonies The penmanship was lacking but the thought was warming to the Vaughan family was 
substitute tackle on the Fullerton High School championship pound team and remember Arky as our star 
halfback fast hard nosed and even then real professional the letter read It was signed Sincerely Richard 
Nixon Arky graduated from Fullerton in Two years later he was the Pirates starting shortstop and hit as 
rookie He hit in and the following year In Arky had the kind of year that couldn help but attract attention 
He flirted with batting average until mid September when he went into for slump Still he finished at best 
in the National League with career high home runs He was named the league most valuable player He 
played for Pittsburgh for the next six seasons and quietly went about the business of becoming one of 
the premiere shortstops of his era He hit or better in each of his seasons with the Pirates In he was 
traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers for catcher Babe Bad Boy Phelps pitcher Luke Hamlin infielder Pete 
Coscarart and outfielder Jim Wasdell It was as Dodger in that Arky shocked his teammates by speaking 
out Dodger manager Leo Durocher unleashed lippy verbal assault on pitcher Bobo Newsome in the 
Dodger clubhouse Arky didn like what he heard and let Durocher know it Wrote Red Smith of the 
incident The quarrel between manager and pitcher raged through the clubhouse involving other 
members of the team and the press and some rather free exchanges of personalities At length Arky 
Vaughan peeled off his uniform bundled it up and handed it to Durocher together with suggestion 
regarding its disposal Such was the respect for Vaughan among other players that the whole club 
promptly went on strike Upper management intervened and convinced the players to take the field 
under Durocher that day But Leo and Arky were never too chummy from then on At the end of that 
season Arky returned to his California ranch and stayed there for three years It was termed voluntary 
retirement which meant the Dodgers still owned his rights It was speculated that Arky left baseball in 
huff over the Durocher incident but only he could say And as was his practice he wasn talking Bob 
Vaughan said the retirement was just matter of priorities My brother Glenn was taking care of Arky 
ranch for him he said He was drafted into the military so Arky had choice to make let the ranch go to pot 
or quit playing ball He took care of the ranch This Durocher thing we really feel is myth If he didn want 
to play for Durocher and the Dodgers in the war years they could have sold him or traded him He was 
pretty valuable merchandise definitely remember asking him Who was the best manager you ever 
played for He told me it was Durocher He didn say he was the one he liked best just that he was the best 
he ever played for And Arky was not the kind of guy who would hold grudge for three years believe me 
He was slow to anger but he could get ticked off But when he did he get it off his chest and then it was 
over with Arky came out of retirement in the same year Durocher was suspended by Commissioner 
Happy Chandler for associating with gamblers His knees were battered from years of wear and tear so 
he was limited to utility role He appeared in games that season and hit He played in his only World 
Series that year getting one hit in two pinch hit appearances as the Dodgers lost to the New York 
Yankees in seven games He played his last season in the major leagues in hitting as pinch hitter and 
reserve outfielder The next year he returned to California where he signed one year contract to play for 
the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League so that he could be closer to the ranch and the places 
he loved to visit to hunt and fish With one exception Arky had avoided calling attention to himself 
throughout year major league career When it was over he headed for the hills far away from limelight 
But he left lasting impression He was one fellow who went out of his way to be nice to me when was 
rookie Jackie Robinson told New York reporter after Arky death needed it The man who emblazoned his 
name in the national pastime record books met death on fishing expedition He died with his boots on 
Arky Vaughan loved to fish When his playing days were over he retired and bought ranch in Eagleville 
tiny town in the northeast corner of California Modoc National Forest to be exact just fraction of an inch 
from the Nevada border on your California road map Every vacation that Dad had we spent in Northern 
California Bob Vaughan said That how Arky got acquainted with the country up there It was here that 
Arky settled into life he loved it was life of fishing hunting and running his cattle ranch It was here that at 
the age of he drowned in fishing accident at Lost Lake Reports of Arky demise were greatly distorted 
One story that circulated the one that was cited at the Hall of Fame Induction ceremonies told of how 
Arky and his companion were swept in sudden storm and tossed from their small fishing boat into the 
cold deep waters of Lost Lake Wrong Another told of Arky becoming entangled in fishing line and 
succumbing before he could free himself Wrong again There was even one story that Arky couldn swim 
Bob Vaughan said Well anything that had to do with athletics that guy could do it The story based on 
information gathered from the only witness to the drowning and the one the Vaughan family has 
accepted as fact is this Bill Wimer Arky friend and neighbor visited the Vaughan ranch to talk Arky into 
going fishing Arky declined saying he had too much work to do that day but Wimer got him to change his 
mind saying the work would be there when he returned Arky asked his wife Margaret who had grown to 
love the outdoors nearly as much as her husband if she wanted to join them but she declined Had she 
gone one relative said they would have fished from the shore of the lake instead of from boat Fishing 
gear in tow Wimer and Arky headed for Lost Lake had been fishing with him couple of times at the same 
place Bob Vaughan said It probably wasn more than or acres of water but it was very very deep and very 
very cold And full of trout When Arky and his companion found place where the trout were biting 
Wimer logger and hulking man of more than pounds stood in the boat to cast Verne Wheeler an elderly 
man who witnessed the accident from the shore told authorities of how the boat overturned sending 
both men into the chilly water Arky was good swimmer but Wimer apparently was not Both men 
headed toward the shore but Wimer began to struggle long before he got there Once he realized his 
plight Wimer began to panic Arky tried to help his companion but outweighed by more than pounds was 
unsuccessful About feet from shore both men went under and never resurfaced Their bodies were 
recovered the next day Those who played with him will never forget Arky Those who were fortunate 
enough to watch his inspired performances on the gridiron court and on the diamond will never forget 
his greatness Today Fullerton pays homage to great athlete sportsman whose name and 
accomplishments are part of the living record The Fullerton Daily News Tribune eulogy four days after 
the death of one of its most famous sons was eloquent Baseball Hall of Fame wasn nearly as timely or 
kind The irony of it all must have left Joseph Floyd Vaughan chuckling He lacked only one thing colorful 
personality Those who knew him best believe he would have been one of the game greatest heroes had 
he been endowed with the sparkling personality that made lesser players great The Town Crier Aug

The Cougars continue to wait for word on medical waiver for wide receiver Andrew Rodriguez who was 
limited to two games as freshman due to groin injury Rodriguez has been limited in spring practice We 
re trying to not overdo anything with him coming back from the injury coach Tony Levine Since the end 
of last season wide receiver Deontay Greenberry has gained pounds and is currently listed at Coach Tony 
Levine said the extra weight will help Greenberry block against bigger linebackers in the Big East that will 
weigh around and pounds Greenberry made the move this spring to the inside position similar to how 
the Cougars used James Cleveland few years ago Coach Tony Levine said moving Kent Brooks from 
safety to running back was to improve depth in the backfield We re just trying to make the best 
decisions as staff where we may be able to use him more to his benefit and our benefit Levine said We 
felt moving him to running back was that position Follow me on Twitter at Joseph DuarteUse of and or

HahmannA handful of moves made this off season could prove very valuable to major league clubs even 
if they lack the buzz of signing Matt Holliday or John Lackey The Cardinals signing of Brad Penny to one 
year contract is one such move Looking at Penny raw numbers may make you think out of my mind 
Penny fantasy stats in Boston were especially awful as the big right hander posted ERA in starts But 
more advanced metrics show that he pitched much better than that Penny posted an unusually high 
batting average on balls in play BABIP of with the Red Sox That figure was points above his career line 
leading to more runs scoring as result of luck defense and other factors out of his control His Fielding 
Independent Pitching FIP measure of factors such as strikeout walk and home run rate that pitcher can 
better control was much more respectable for the Red Sox Nevertheless Penny was cut by Boston and 
subsequently signed by San Francisco The move back to the NL where Penny had great success over the 
first nine seasons of his career proved to be beneficial career move Away from the much tougher 
American League East he posted ERA in innings pitched with the Giants This time Penny benefited from 
good luck posting microscopic BABIP in San Francisco and FIP that showed the true performance gap 
between his stints with the Red Sox and Giants to be much smaller than his runs lower ERA suggested 
Still those IP are what earned Penny his chance with the Cardinals and pitching coach extraordinaire 
Dave Duncan The list of pitchers Duncan has helped turn around while in St Louis is impressive with 
Chris Carpenter and Joel Pineiro the two most prominent recent examples Duncan teaches his pitchers 
to throw sinking fastball with the goal of generating more outs early in counts and preventing home 
runs and other extra base hits In recent LA Times article Pineiro said Duncan has all his guys throwing 
sinkers He just said want you to trust it and throw it Coming into last season Pineiro hadn posted an ERA 
below or an FIP below since full season in the Duncan Pitching School would change that Pineiro fastball 
usage which had been above just one time in his career jumped to last season most of them of the 
sinking variety That big increase in sinkers resulted in his groundball percentage rocketing to after never 
topping in his pre St Louis days Other recent reclamation projects of Duncan include Todd Wellemeyer 
and Kyle Lohse In Wellemeyer fringe swingman and reliever to that point won games for the Cardinals 
posting ERA and BB ratio of better than That same season the newly acquired Lohse who never posted 
an ERA below in his previous seven seasons enjoyed the best year of his career under Duncan going with 
ERA Penny owns better pedigree than Pineiro Lohse or Wellemeyer he also thrown fastballs at least of 
the time in five different seasons which should make for an easier transition to the Duncan system 
Penny should benefit from strong offense behind him this season led by Matt Holliday and Albert Pujols 
guy He also figures to benefit from facing some weak offenses four of the Cardinals five division rivals 
ranked among the bottom of baseball in runs scored Would be Penny owners have may reason for 
concern on the defensive front The Cardinals defense struggled last year as the team ranked just th in

server can not find the requested pageIn two seasons at Oklahoma State forward Kamari Murphy played 
role that didn change all that often Defending rebounding and being supplemental figure on the 
offensive end were his responsibilities and there didn seem to be much room for him to go outside of 
those roles After sophomore season in which he averaged points and rebounds per game Murphy 
decided to transfer and ultimately wound up joining Miami program that also worked hard to reel him in 
as high school prospect but fell short Now eligible to compete after sitting out last season the foot 
Murphy is eager to take the floor And with that comes the desire to show that he can do lot more skill 
wise than he was able to do in two seasons in Stillwater as noted in story written by Christy Cabrera 
Chirinos of the Sun Sentinel The two years was at Oklahoma State we had great teams but think was 
used in the wrong way and the media and press got the wrong perception of me that just rebounder or 
set screen guy Murphy said more than that This year not going to do too much but going to show people 
have the skill work and my IQ is better than just setting screens and running the floor That why can wait 
to play to prove people wrong Murphy joins front court that includes seniors Tonye Jekiri and Ivan Cruz 
Uceda and there is room for the New York native to show off wider array of skills One of Miami 
personnel losses from last season was forward Omar Sherman who transferred after averaging points 
and rebounds per contest as freshman While Sherman didn post prolific numbers he was face up four 
who could step out onto the perimeter and hit shots in pick and pop situations Can Murphy fill similar 
role for the Hurricanes who have the pieces needed to return to the NCAA tournament after missing out 
in each of the last two seasons Given Miami numbers in the front court with just five scholarship options 
head coach Jim Larra aga and his staff will need Murphy to not only fill that role but be more productive 
in doing so Former Oklahoma State power forward Kamari Murphy committed to play his final two years 
of college ball at Miami he announced on Wednesday Murphy averaged points and boards as 
sophomore with the Cowboys He started for much of the season after Michael Cobbins went down with 
an achilles injury in December Murphy will have to sit out the season due to the NCAA transfer 
regulations but he will have two years of eligibility remaining in He the latest example of head coach Jim 
Larranaga ability to tap into the Big transfer market Miami will be adding former Kansas State guard 
Angel Rodriguez and former Texas wing Sheldon McClellan this season Follow robdausterKamari Murphy 
became the most recent player to exit the Oklahoma State program when he announced his decision to 
transfer on May The foot sophomore is planning on visiting pair of programs in Florida in early June 
Murphy Brooklyn native who attended IMG Academy in Florida is scheduled to visit South Florida on 
June and Miami week later according to Adam Zagoria of SNY tv who spoke with Murphy former AAU 
coach Dana Dingle Miami head coach Jim Larranaga has scored with transfers in the past most recently 
his back court of Angel Rodriguez Kansas State and Sheldon McClellan Texas both of whom are eligible 
this upcoming season South Florida hired Kentucky assistant Orlando Antigua on April It didn take him 
long to land his first impact transfer in ex Marshall point guard Kareem Canty Murphy averaged points 
and boards per game for the Cowboys being inserted into the starting lineup when Michael Cobbins 
went down with an injury in late December He ll have two years left to play once he sits out the season 
due to NCAA transfer rules Follow terrence payneOklahoma State has lost another key piece from last 
season team as Kamari Murphy has decided to transfer out of the program according to multiple media 
reports As sophomore this past season Murphy averaged points and boards He became starter when 
Michael Cobbins went down with torn achilles Of the eight players that Oklahoma State had in their 
rotation at the start of the season five of them are now gone and four left with eligibility remaining 
Murphy and Brian Williams transferred Marcus Smart went pro Stevie Clark was kicked out of the 
program in December and Markel Brown graduated That list doesn include Jared Terrell either Terrell 
was the crown jewel of Ford recruiting class but he got out of his letter of intent last month That leaves 
Travis Ford with roster that is going to be dreadfully thin once again The good news He does return Le 
Bryan Nash for what should be big senior season and Cobbins and Phil Forte should be back as well Add 
in five man recruiting class headlined by JuCo transfer Jeff Newberry and the cupboard isn completely 
bare but it still hard to see how Ford is going to be able to get this team into the NCAA tournament 
Which brings us back to point that was brought up by Berry Tramel of The Oklahoman back when the 
Pokes were bounced from the NCAA tournament in their first game Travis Ford contract is doozy The 
school signed him to year deal back in meaning that Ford still has five years and almost million coming to 
him The most important note The school has no buy out If they want Ford out they have to pay him the 
remainder of his salary and not sure even Boone Pickens is willing to shell out that kind of cash for

basketball It no wonder that the Cowboys can no longer fill up Gallagher Iba Arena They have head 
coach that the fans hate that couldn get the Pokes out of the opening round of the NCAA tournament 
despite having two seasons with Smart Nash and Brown on the roster and it doesn look like it will get 
any better anytime soon Ford always been able to recruit but it will be interesting to see if players still 
want to join program that clearly not in good place these days All month long CBT will be rolling out our 
season preview Check back throughout the day as we ll be posting three or four preview items every day

Olukemi Philip JurickNewcomers Stevie Clark Jeff Carroll Leyton Hammonds Gary GaskinProjected 
Lineup Marcus Smart SoMarkel Brown SrBrian Williams JrLe Bryan Nash JrMichael Cobbins JrBench Gary 
Gaskins Jr Kamari Murphy So Phil Forte So Stevie Clark Fr They ll be good because Travis Ford has 
managed to amass as much perimeter talent as any team in the country Let start with the obvious 
Marcus Smart After an all american freshman season that had him projected as top five pick in the NBA 
Draft Smart made the decision to return to school for his sophomore season giving the Pokes arguably 
the best player in the country He point guard in shooting guard body whose biggest contributions have 
much more to do with the intangibles and things that don show up in the box score than the points 
boards and assists he averaged last year Smart not alone either Markel Brown may be the most 
underrated guard in the country proving last season that he is more than just dunker Brian Williams is 
finally healthy and should be lock down defender on the wing while Le Bryan Nash is an immensely 
talented combo forward that has yet to reach his potential Throw in high scoring little guards Phil Forte 
and Stevie Clark and Oklahoma State is going to be able to give opponents multiple different looks But 
they might disappoint because Michael Cobbins was productive as sophomore averaging points boards 
and blocks last year and should be in line to see jump in those numbers The same can be said for 
sophomore Kamari Murphy Both are athletic foot forwards with long arms that can make some plays on 
the glass and on the defensive end of the floor Gary Gaskins is foot pogo stick but he weighs all of about 
pounds The problem however is that neither of those guys are what you would consider bruiser inside 
That role was played by Philip Jurick last season and he graduated Can the Pokes survive without that 
big body in the lane Outlook Travis Ford probably hates Andrew Wiggins If Kansas hadn landed the No 
recruit in the country Oklahoma State would be heading into this season as the favorite to win the Big 
The Jayhawks have had an unprecedented run of success dominating the league over the last nine years 
the last time that Kansas didn win at least share of the league title was back in Oklahoma State has real 
chance to bring that streak to an end this season This is the best team that Ford has ever coached and it 
may be the best team that he ever will coach Smart is an all american and arguably the most valuable 
player in the country and his supporting cast will be better than it was year ago It stretch to say that 
Oklahoma State should win the conference but given how weak the rest of league is outside of Kansas 
anything less than second place finish in the Big would be disappointment There enough talent on this 
roster to make run at the Final Four come MarchIona English and St Peter Desi Washington were each 
suspended one game for their roles in last Saturday benches clearing brawl The Gaels the top team in 
the MAAC didn have time to celebrate their overtime win over the Peacocks as tempers flared shortly 
after the final buzzer Caught in the middle of the heated exchanged was English and Washington At one 
point one of the referees removed English from the scuffle only to be tossed aside by the foot shooting 
guard Both schools announced one game suspensions for their respective players Saint Peter places high 
premium on sportsmanship and we will continue to be strong proponent of this fundamental principle 
throughout our athletic programs and the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference St Peter athletic director 
Joe Quinlan said in statement via NJ com Iona described English actions and subsquent punishment as 
the initiation of an unsportsmanlike incident according to statement from the university obtained by 
Ryan Restivo of NYCBuckets com English is arguably the conference top player averaging points 
rebounds and assists per game He will miss Friday night game against Siena He will be available for 
Sunday afternoon against Marist Washington St Peter leading scorer at points per game will sit out 
Saturday matchup with Fairfield Iona and St Peter face each other once more in the regular season 
finale on March Follow terrence payneGame of the day Wichita State BradleyThe No ranked Shockers 
had little trouble notching their th regular season victory dispatching Bradley summarily and with ease 
as Ron Baker led all scorers with points and the team converted percent from long range Gregg Marshall 
squad is now the first in men college basketball history to win that many games before their conference 
tournament Next stop is win number which could come Saturday against Missouri State and then 
potentially wins through during Arch MadnessImportant outcomesMinnesota Iowa Not to discount 
Minnesota victory we saw what the ideal Richard Pitino Gopher offense one predicated on constant ball 
movement might resemble in tonight contest but Iowa is struggling to get any stops During the past two 
Iowa games both losses the team has allowed shocking points per possession Part of the problem is 
Melsahn Basabe absence the big is suffering from an illness and played only one minute against 
Wisconsin and didn take the court versus Minnesota The Hawkeyes need Basabe as rim deterrent and 
also for his defensive rebounding prowess his defensive rebounding percentage leads the team by wide 
margin Saint Joseph Dayton As Rob Dauster detailed in Bubble Banter Dayton tournament hopes took 
hit but since the squad has the hardest remaining schedule games against UMass Saint Louis and 
Richmond there are still ample opportunities for the Flyers to earn an at large bid This was crucial win 
for the Hawks for sure one cemented by the play of Chris Wilson and Ronald Roberts Jr the duo was of 
from the field Xavier St John Xavier path to the NCAA tournament got bit easier while St John route got 
significantly more problematic The middle of the Big East to quote much better wordsmith than myself 
has spent the past several weeks cannibalizing itself Four teams group that includes SJU and XU are 
fighting for the Big East bid scraps Up to two teams and that is generous estimtion will make the NCAAs 
and even with the Musketeers victory Chris Mack team still needs at least one conference tournament 
win this is assuming they win out against Creighton and Villanova StarredCharles Buggs He can do some 
things that you are going to go Wow and he shows you tonight This was how Pitino addressed the play 
of his freshman Buggs forward had scored just five points this season before tonight point eruption Desi 
Washington In early January the Saint Peter guard hit three pointer at the buzzer to defeat Fairfield 
Washington must really not like the Stags because he added an encore knocking down game winner 
with seconds remaining to help boost the Peacocks again over their MAAC opponent Jalen Reynolds 
Even though St John boasted frontcourt chock full of top recruits and junior college All Americans the 
Red Storm had no answer for Xavier redshirt freshman Reynolds scored points and grabbed rebounds 
thoroughly dismantling SJU interior StruggledAngelo Harrison The junior guard isn shooter he is volume 
scorer who will have off games Unfortunately for Steve Lavin and his staff Harrison down night came at 
the possibly the worst time The guard was nearly blanked from the field making one of his eleven field 
goal attempts and his point production was sorely missed in game SJU needed to win in order to safely 
dance KJ McDaniels Clemson was set to win three in row feat the Tigers hadn accomplished since mid 
January but somehow dropped contest to struggling Wake Forest team McDaniels Clemson top 
offensive threat could not find any semblance of offensive rhythm and scored ten points on eleven 
attempts Wesley Iwundu The freshman wing had solid game points and Kansas State won game they 
needed to take to keep up with the rest of the Big but Iwundu cracked this list for his Andrew Bogut like 
performance from the free throw line pretending to high five invisible teammates after made freebie 
GAME OF THE NIGHT Baylor Kentucky It didn have the atmosphere of game that was one of the season 
biggest to date since it was played at Cowboys Stadium in Dallas but Baylor announced themselves to 
the country as top team They did it with Kenny Chery Junior College transfer in his first season with the 
program leading the way As good as Baylor looked as team Kentucky revealed more flaws that need 
correcting John Calipari knows this and sees this It is why he continues to make mention of the work 
that needs to be done with this Kentucky team He has his hands full especially with the tough stretch of 
games upcoming IMPORTANT OUTCOMES On the surface many will think UC Santa Barbara beating 
California is an upset When team from the Big West knocks off Pac program it almost always is one But 
make no mistake about it this was an upset in name only The Gauchos are really good and they have 
one of the best forwards in the country you may have never heard of read more here Pittsburgh 
continues their dominant ways by handily beating Loyola Marymount The Panthers stay perfect on the 
season moving to Pittsburgh is good but when will Jamie Dixon put together competitive non 
conference schedule Until they face an opponent that truly challenges them either Stanford or Penn 
State has been their best opponent it hard to know just how good Pittsburgh is In an underrated good 
game of what was otherwise quiet night Stephen Austin beat Towson The Lumberjacks are now on the 
season they and Oral Roberts are looking like the two top teams in the Southland Conference STARRED 
If not for Kenny Chery Baylor loses to Kentucky He tallied points and five assists along with hitting critical 
shot in the final minute to make it two possession game Alan Williams for UC Santa Barbara missed 
consecutive games earlier this season due to back spasms Tonight against Cal he was in his usual form 
beasting opposing frontcourts as he went off for points and rebounds in the win Conference play in the 
MAAC has officially begun and Canisius center Jordan Heath had big night against St Peter totaling point 
and rebounds in an victory Oklahoma State and Connecticut barely broke sweat tonight as each cruised 
to wins over their opponents The Huskies handled Maine and the Cowboys beat South Carolina 
STRUGGLED Jeff Bower hasn exactly gotten off to the best start in his second stint as coach at Marist 
nine games and nine losses The latest one tonight came against Manhattan as the Red Foxes lost Fresh 
off of their win over Oregon State DePaul came out and laid an egg against visiting Arizona State losing 
As team they shot worse than from the field with Cleveland Melvin hands down their best player going 
Alex Poythress is an enigma The foot sophomore received lot of hype but hasn lived up to it Once 
projected to be surefire lottery pick in the NBA Draft who would most likely leave Kentucky after year or 
two Poythress is no longer going down that road In the loss to Baylor he played just six minutes and 
committed three fouls while going from the field and from the line Follow KLDoyle All month long CBT

preview items every day To browse through the preview posts we ve already published click here To see 
the rest of the Conference Previews we ve published click here For schedule of our previews for the 
month click here Last season was supposed to be the year that Manhattan in Steve Masiello second year 
at the helm made their move in the MAAC They were coming off record in Masiello first year and 
George Beamon the leading scorer in the league in was returning for his senior season An ankle injury to 
Beamon derailed Manhattan as they got out to start yet they rebounded by making it to the MAAC 
championship nearly beating Iona With healthy Beamon back for fifth year Ashton Pankey Maryland 
transfer who sat out last season now eligible and two time defensive player of the year Rhamel Brown 
returning in the frontcourt the Jaspers are the favorite to win the MAAC and return to the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time since Many point to Iona Manhattan bitter rival as the primary challenger 
Understandably so as the Gaels have been to the NCAA Tournament the past two seasons and return 
two of the league top players in Sean Armand and David Laury While they will no doubt challenge 
Canisius is poised to have big year with Billy Baron returning for his senior season Factor in guard Chris 
Perez who is using his final year of eligibility after graduating from Stetson this past May where he 
earned All Atlantic Sun Second Team and Canisius has the top backcourt in the league Two programs 
that may be on the uptick are Rider and Marist The Broncs surprised everyone last year finishing second 
in the league and return two of the top players in Anthony Myles and Daniel Stewart Marist meanwhile 
struggled for much of last season finishing with record which proved to be the demise of Chuck Martin 
In comes Jeff Bower an assistant at Marist from and former general manager of the New Orleans 
Hornets to try and right the ship He steps into program that returns Adam Kemp and Chavaughn Lewis 
who both earned Third Team All MAAC honors last season In their first season in the MAAC Quinnipiac 
will be instantly competitive as they return Ike Azotam and Ousamane Drame in the frontcourt While 
they don figure to contend right away Siena under first year coach Jimmy Patsos will be story to watch

this serverBy Brie Stark former BMC rower and Philadelphia Inquirer Rowing Performer of the Year was 
selected to cox the Cambridge University Women Lightweights in the famous Henley Boat Races against 
Oxford University which recently took place on March th The races as the name would have it usually 
take place at Henley on the river Thames This year due to strong winds and current the race was moved 
to Eton Dorney Lake where the London Olympics were held Race day was brutal to say the least The 
wind chill was about degrees Fahrenheit and despite wearing several layers everyone was frozen when 
we got to the starting line Even though the race was moved to Dorney from Henley on account of the 
wind the wind that day was still remarkably strong degree crosswind that blew along the course at mph 
This crosswind made my coxing job much more difficult especially as knew my boat lightweight crew 
each girl weighing maximum of lbs would have harder time dealing with the conditions than 
heavyweight crew might After pulling into the stake boats we began hard fought race against the dark 
blues We were the first off the starting blocks with Oxford drawing even roughly meters in We 
continued to vie for position for quite some time before Oxford began to move through us though we 
steadily fought throughout the entire race We were hit strongly with crosswind at the meter mark 
halfway and fought to regain steady rhythm afterwards which felt was the biggest struggle of the race 
Though we did not win my team and feel that we did our best and look forward to coming against 
Oxford again at the British University Colleges Sport Championships in early May Before this big race we 
had several sparring matches with crews from around the country in which we defeated several top 
boats even more impressive they were all heavyweight boats The motto of my boat small but mighty 
with lot of fightBrie is the person at the left of the photo wearing hat and facing opposite from 
othersBrie is third row from the bottom all the way to the leftUniversity of Massachusetts Boston 
William Morrissey Blvd Boston MAThere have been Pac basketball tournaments in the event second life 
but none quite like this There have been heavy favorites and there have been muddled masses of teams 
with designs on the crown Never have we encountered this combination of heavy favorite and second 
tier logjam Arizona should win and might even win all three games handily But if the Wildcats don win it 
chaos You have as much chance of picking winner at the MGM Grand Garden Arena as beating the 
house at the MGM Grand Casino This is conference that played games only to produce five team tie for 
third place It conference that saw the second place team lose to the th place team last weekend by 
points My view of potential chaos is shaped by skepticism of UCLA don see the second seeded Bruins as 
any more likely to win the tournament than the mass that tied for third place and let throw Utah into 
the mix of contenders How much faith can you have in team that lost to Washington State by and didn 
record single road sweep in league play and lost to Washington State by Doesn matter if the Bruins had 
locked up the No seed Elite teams don play the way UCLA played in Pullman under any circumstances 
Two other points regarding the Pac tourney which begins today The league would be best served by 
Arizona losing to Cal or Colorado in the semifinal because it would help propel another team into the 
NCAAs Each NCAA unit is worth approx this season by the way That to the conference for every team 
that participates and every win that collected How it looks right now Arizona and UCLA are locks Oregon 
in good shape ASU Stanford and Colorado appear to be on solid ground and Cal smack on the bubble 
Don try convincing Sean Miller of this or Arizona fans for that matter but one could argue that the 
Wildcats would benefit from losing in the semifinals Their NCAA seed won change and loss in the semis 
would help avoid the wear and tear that comes with three games in three days realize they re headed to 
San Diego next week and that short trip and Friday Sunday site But this is essentially six man team in the 
post Brandon Ashley world the Cats need to be as fresh as possible for what could be long grinding run 
through the Madness Losing in the semifinals is the best of all scenarios They earn one victory to 
maintain confidence especially after the loss at Oregon They play two games to stay sharp continuing 
the regular season schedule format And they would avoid that third game the game that takes toll The 
Wildcats would have hours between the quarters and semis but only between the semis and final They 
will need quality minutes and lots of them from Jordin Mayes and Elliott Pitts this week Six man teams 
three games in three days potential for tired legs Arizona fans Start your ire My picks OPENING ROUND

politics Sangakkara said in statement that he believes that politics and public service is very serious 
responsibility There have been reports that Sangakkara may contest as common candidate at the 
Presidential elections in Sri Lanka have read with sense of concern reports of my imminent entry into 
politics in Sri Lanka as possible candidate for the presidential election in was also made aware of varying 
opinions and speculations on this from both members of the public and media have by what hear and 
read been touted as suitable candidate by some while that others have questioned my credibility and 
character While respectfully appreciating the varying diverse opinions made public would like to put to 
rest speculation and rumour once and for all confirming that do not harbour any ambitions for political 
office never have and with enormous certainty can say never will he said The former cricketer says 
public duty should always be served with accountability and integrity holding sacrosanct the public trust 
have the greatest respect for those public servants whether elected or appointed who are motivated by 
good and honourable intentions and are therefore steadfastly committed to the betterment of our 
country he said Sangakkara also said that while he has no political ambitions he does hope that Sri 
Lankans will have the patience and foresight to not only vote the best suited and most qualified persons 
into public office but also thereafter retain patience as positive social and economic change will not be 
achieved overnight also hope that we have the strength to continuously agitate and demand integrity 
accountability transparency and respect from our elected politicians ensuring they fully appreciate and 
understand they that are entrusted with our will to be exercised with responsibility in manner that 
benefits all in our society equally he said Post cricket Sangakkara says his plan is first and foremost to 
focus on his family after many years of sacrifice on their part while he was away playing cricket around

exciting new phase of my life Finally wish to continue to work with existing charitable partners and

North Merion Avenue Bryn Mawr PA PhoneBy Brie Stark former BMC rower and Philadelphia Inquirer 
Rowing Performer of the Year was selected to cox the Cambridge University Women Lightweights in the 
famous Henley Boat Races against Oxford University which recently took place on March th The races as 
the name would have it usually take place at Henley on the river Thames This year due to strong winds 
and current the race was moved to Eton Dorney Lake where the London Olympics were held Race day 
was brutal to say the least The wind chill was about degrees Fahrenheit and despite wearing several 
layers everyone was frozen when we got to the starting line Even though the race was moved to Dorney 
from Henley on account of the wind the wind that day was still remarkably strong degree crosswind that 
blew along the course at mph This crosswind made my coxing job much more difficult especially as knew 
my boat lightweight crew each girl weighing maximum of lbs would have harder time dealing with the 
conditions than heavyweight crew might After pulling into the stake boats we began hard fought race 
against the dark blues We were the first off the starting blocks with Oxford drawing even roughly meters 
in We continued to vie for position for quite some time before Oxford began to move through us though 
we steadily fought throughout the entire race We were hit strongly with crosswind at the meter mark 
halfway and fought to regain steady rhythm afterwards which felt was the biggest struggle of the race 
Though we did not win my team and feel that we did our best and look forward to coming against 
Oxford again at the British University Colleges Sport Championships in early May Before this big race we 
had several sparring matches with crews from around the country in which we defeated several top

golfers are searching for great top of the backswing position and really struggle to find it and here is why 
The Picture above is classic example of flying elbow cupped wrist and across the line position that see 
amongst many golfers at my facility These lead to poor shaped shots blocks hooks push cuts etc and 
most certainly miss hit shots from all over the clubface with mixture of heavy and thinned golf shots 
Sometimes there is physical element that causes this position at the top in which we do quick flexibility 
test to see how mobile the arms and shoulders are as the range of motion can be limited through injury 
or lack of flexibility Some golfers can just have too much flexibility and just be completely unaware of 
where they are swinging up to in the backswing Once we have established the clients ROM we can then 
proceed in the below exercise on making them aware of the feelings the correct position for them at the 
top of the backswing should feel like Grip the golf club with the Left Hand below the right for right 
handed golfers and the opposite for left handed golfers right below left Picture above Good position at 
the TopSwinging up to the top of the backswing will feel very different it will feel more restricted the left 
wrist for right handed golfers will be much flatter the right elbow will be much more down and in more 
in front of the body This will lead to the shaft being much more in the slot and the clubface will be 
square leading edge matched up to the left arm Your body will be much more in balance and engaged 
with the movements you are making To start with you will feel that you are doing less as there are fewer 
moving parts Try to use mirror when doing this exercise to link up the feel with the visual Your shot 
shape and distance will improve dramatically and so will the ball striking with the centred strikes off the 
clubface hope you enjoyed the article any comments or Questions then please leave comment below

Comeback The Cubs and Rockies played eight normal innings and one wacky one at Wrigley Field on 
Monday Through the eighth inning the Cubs led Then the real action started Todd Helton Garrett Atkins 
and Brad Hawpe pounded out RBI hits with two outs to make the score Then with two men on Troy 
Tulowitzki blasted homer to give the Rockies lead and complete an incredible six run comeback However 
the game wasn over quite yet throwing error by the Rockies with two outs in the bottom of the ninth 
loaded up the bases for Alfonso Soriano Soriano then singled driving in two and giving the Cubs wacky 
win This is one of those games that shows why you should never leave ballgame after the eighth inning 
no matter what the score is It was the Cubs third straight win while the Rockies were hit with their 
fourth straight lossAnother start another win The day after Josh Beckett reached wins CC Sabathia of the 
Indians matched him Sabathia improved to with complete game shutdown of the It was his third 
complete game in his last five starts good for the AL lead Sabathia allowed two runs walked none and 
struck out eight in the Indians victory Like Beckett Sabathia record is aided by great run support he has 
ERA but he is still worthy of Cy Young consideration The continued their downward fall after great first 
half of the month losing their fourth straight gameWho wants first The NL West has made remarkable 
turnaround from the league worst division two years ago to its most competitive one today It seems like 
every week first place is up for grabs as the Diamondbacks Dodgers and Padres have all posted strong 
records Right now the key series is Dodgers backs as the two teams are separated by half game in series 
that will decide who in first place The Dodgers won game one on Monday as Brad Penny made another 
excellent start Penny improved to on the month and overall as he allowed one run to Arizona in innings 
of work Penny who started the All Star game last year might do so again this year as he leads the league

All rights reserved Powered by WordPress Wordpress Themes XHTMLThere have been Pac basketball 
tournaments in the event second life but none quite like this There have been heavy favorites and there 
have been muddled masses of teams with designs on the crown Never have we encountered this 
combination of heavy favorite and second tier logjam Arizona should win and might even win all three 
games handily But if the Wildcats don win it chaos You have as much chance of picking winner at the 
MGM Grand Garden Arena as beating the house at the MGM Grand Casino This is conference that 
played games only to produce five team tie for third place It conference that saw the second place team 
lose to the th place team last weekend by points My view of potential chaos is shaped by skepticism of 
UCLA don see the second seeded Bruins as any more likely to win the tournament than the mass that 
tied for third place and let throw Utah into the mix of contenders How much faith can you have in team 
that lost to Washington State by and didn record single road sweep in league play and lost to 
Washington State by Doesn matter if the Bruins had locked up the No seed Elite teams don play the way 
UCLA played in Pullman under any circumstances Two other points regarding the Pac tourney which 
begins today The league would be best served by Arizona losing to Cal or Colorado in the semifinal 
because it would help propel another team into the NCAAs Each NCAA unit is worth approx this season 
by the way That to the conference for every team that participates and every win that collected How it 
looks right now Arizona and UCLA are locks Oregon in good shape ASU Stanford and Colorado appear to 
be on solid ground and Cal smack on the bubble Don try convincing Sean Miller of this or Arizona fans 
for that matter but one could argue that the Wildcats would benefit from losing in the semifinals Their 
NCAA seed won change and loss in the semis would help avoid the wear and tear that comes with three 
games in three days realize they re headed to San Diego next week and that short trip and Friday Sunday 
site But this is essentially six man team in the post Brandon Ashley world the Cats need to be as fresh as 
possible for what could be long grinding run through the Madness Losing in the semifinals is the best of 
all scenarios They earn one victory to maintain confidence especially after the loss at Oregon They play 
two games to stay sharp continuing the regular season schedule format And they would avoid that third 
game the game that takes toll The Wildcats would have hours between the quarters and semis but only 
between the semis and final They will need quality minutes and lots of them from Jordin Mayes and 
Elliott Pitts this week Six man teams three games in three days potential for tired legs Arizona fans Start

Canada Jeff Mingay is student of the history of golf course architecture Mingay most recently assisted 
fellow Canadian golf architect Rod Whitman with the design and construction of Blackhawk Golf Club in 
suburban Edmonton scheduled to open for play in July Presently Mingay is working with American golf 
architect Mike DeVries on the design and construction of new hole course at Marquette Country Club in 
the upper peninsula of Michigan As writer Mingay contributes articles and essays on the subjects of 
course design construction and maintenance to international publications including Golfweek Golfweek 
Superintendent News and LINKS in the United States SCOREGolf and SCOREGolf com in Canada and the 
Society of Australian Golf Course Architect annual journal Golf Architecture He also contributes regular 
golf course design related column to GreenMaster the official magazine of the Canadian Golf 
Superintendents Association Recently the Stanley Thompson Society commissioned Mingay to edit and 
contribute to series of technical manuals intended to encourage and assist clubs golf architects and 
course superintendents with the restoration and future preservation of Thompson designed courses 
throughout the world Mingay is also at work on his second book tentatively titled The Fine Art of Classic 
Golf Course Restoration which is scheduled to be published by John Wiley Sons New York in Mingay first 
book One Hundred Years History of Essex Golf Country Club was published in November Not many 
unfortunately When started work on the Essex book made point to collect history books from other 
clubs principally to help determine how to present our book best As my collection grew so did my 
disappointment in club history books as genre There are few stand outs though Garden City book 
immediately comes to mind along with Chicago Golf Club history by Ross Goodard and of course Geoff 
Shackelford Riviera Country Club history which might be the best of the lot also like the latest history of 
Pine Valley written by James Finegan And George Bahto little soft cover booklet on the history of The 
Knoll Country Club in New Jersey which features neat set of sketches by the author that detail the design 
history and evolution of all holes there by Charles Banks And although it actually more of course history 
than club history Tom Paul booklet on the design evolution of Gulph Mills in suburban Philadelphia is 
very good too In fact others interested in documenting the design evolution of their home course should 
endeavour to get copy of Tom booklet obviously don claim to have seen every club history book ever 
made andI sure there are others with which unacquainted like Werner Shelley earlier history of Pine 
Valley for example that are at least comparable to the ones ve mentioned above will say though without 
exception the very best ones ve seen have been written by club members with special place in their 
hearts for the subject at hand The club histories written by outsiders tend to be comparatively bland 
think Principally find too many club history books glorify the present when they should celebrate the 
past In other words there are far too many books that feature those ego stroking photos of current 
members dancing with their wives at Christmas parties photos that are completely insignificant to club 
history Yet there they are prominently featured in so many club history books for the sake of living 
members who get some sort of cheap thrill seeing their photo in book had to fight to keep few of those 
types of photos out of the Essex book lost few battles unfortunately But did win the war also amazed 
that so few club history books shed adequate light on the design heritage history and evolution of the 
golf course The golf course after all is the life blood of any golf related club mean if the golf course didn 
exist the club wouldn either And yet the golf course takes back seat to social aspects in many of the club 
history books ve seen In contrast the Chicago Garden City and Riviera books all feature comprehensive 
sections on those respective courses including biographies and analysis of their architects and builders 
too That what at least in part makes those particular club history books superior to others in my view 
Granted it takes talented dedicated individual who truly understands golf and course architecture to 
research the history of an old course and then to effectively write about it Which is obviously yet 
another reason we find so few top notch club histories The fact is the Geoff Shackelford of the world are 
few and far between You re absolutely right imagine that if broke down the hours spent working on the 
Essex book into dollars and cents confirm my suspicion that lost money on the project But that ok As 
strange as it may seem to someone more business minded didn take on the job for financial gain guess 
you could call it labour of love Before the project actually took off in earnest had already researched the 
history of the golf course studied Donald Ross golf architecture too and tracked down his original plans 
for Essex at the Tufts Archive in Pinehurst NC along with few old aerials of the course That was easy for 
me because of my interest in golf course design and the history of my home course had no idea how 
much work was going to be involved with putting together the entire book though At the start 
innocently viewed the project as hobby that really suited my interests It turned out to be much more 
than that But the experience has served me well mean who else besides golf club interested in putting 
together history book for relatively inexpensive price was going to offer year old kid with limited writing 
experience at the time an opportunity to be published It was unique opportunity for me to prove could 
tackle the job of completing page book that would exceed people expectations think it should But 
ultimately it depends how the book is put together Those club histories that glorify the present are 
immediately dated They have no relevance once those present day members featured inside for their 
dancing prowess are gone In other words don imagine someone picking up that type of book years from 
now is going to be very interested to read about and look at photos of Christmas party held at the club 
in What does that have to do with the club history On the other hand do think that years from now 
people will be interested to read about the details and circumstances surrounding the establishment of 
the club and the design heritage history and evolution of the golf course That type of club history book is 
timeless It won lose its relevance ever And thus it can be referenced by future generations of club 
members interested in preserving club traditions and the integrity of the original design of the course 
and perhaps the original clubhouse architecture too think well done club history book that includes 
comprehensive section on the golf course is definitely invaluable to consulting architect After all part of 
the architect job is to trace and chronicle the design history and evolution of the course before devising 
long range plan whether it be restorative based or otherwise If that work has already been completed 
and neatly organized the golf architect is relived of spending significant amount of time on historical 
research which can prove to be very challenging particularly in foreign locale In fact it usually takes 
motivated and historically inspired club member to instigate restorative based project And more 
importantly to see that it carried through successfully There are more than few really good examples 
throughout the United States where consulting architects who have benefited from excellent historical 
research done by club members Enough good examples in fact hesitate to cite only the few aware of No 
Many classic clubhouses from the pre World War II have also been under appreciated and either 
distastefully remodelled or altogether destroyed In many cases during the and the clubhouse architect 
was more famous than Donald Ross or whoever might have designed the golf course Many of those old 
interwar period buildings were works of art themselves equally worthy of reverence and preservation as 
the classic courses The best clubhouses were planned to compliment the course as well Sadly though 
can think of more than few clubs with Golden Age courses that have done all the wrong things to their 
clubhouse for all the right reasons feel those new and or remodelled clubhouses almost always detract 
from the experience wonderful old clubhouse with unique character is an irreplaceable asset Think of 
Merion and Gulph Mills in Philadephia the National Golf Links of America Riviera Country Club of Detroit 
St George in Toronto and Essex too where the original low profile English tutor style clubhouse designed 
by George Masson is still intact All of those clubhouses add measurably to the experience at those 
historic havens of golf And each one is completely unique Masson did some significant work in the 
Windsor Detroit area in the pre World War II era His clubhouse at Essex is wonderful compliment to 
Ross course Without it Essex wouldn be the same Just like Winged Foot for example wouldn be the 
same without its magnificent clubhouse We were lucky to find historic interior and exterior photos of 
the Essex clubhouse taken shortly after it opened in July They were in dusty envelope in storage room in 
the basement of the Windsor Public Library The photos are compliment to the club in terms of the 
outstanding job directors have done to preserve the integrity of its original design both inside and out 
There no doubt that imagined the book might serve well to encourage restoration of Ross original 
design Sure think in any case there no better tool to educate club members about the history of the golf 
course than club history book While most Essex members have long been proud of the course heritage 
and thus have adamantly opposed altering the fundamental nature of Ross original design few people 
clearly understand how much the course has actually still changed over the years as result of natural 
evolutionary processes and the adverse affects of everyday play and maintenance Not to mention few 
minor ill advised design alterations made So attempted to make those parts of the book that deal with 
the golf course clear and concise explanation of Ross original design concept the subsequent evolution 
of the course and also the plans that have been tabled by golf architect Bruce Hepner of Renaissance 
Golf Design to restore it The results of my efforts in that regard remain to be seen But can say have 
spoken to few potentially influential Essex members who are enthused about the prospects The sixth is 
the only green at Essex that been physically altered since the course opened for play in July That green 
originally featured large mound at front left that rose some four feet above the body of the putting 
surface As the story goes few influential Essex golfers thought it unfair that what they perceived to be 
good shot to back left hole location would often carom off the down slope over the green Little did they 
realize they were simply pitching the ball in the wrong spot So the mound was removed in in house on 
recommendation of the Green committee As result what might have been the most unique and 
challenging green at Essex is today perhaps the most non descript putting surface on the course The way 
imagine it trying to pitch the ball precisely short of the putting surface in order to successfully negotiate 
that mound from any distance long or short must have been one of the most exciting shots at Essex In 
his book Golf Has Never Failed Me Ross wrote There are holes on some Scottish links where knowledge 
of these peculiarities is absolutely imperative in order to get the ball near the hole The ball has to be 
pitched to about certain spot where it will surely take the roll of the hillock and stop somewhere near 
the flag Obviously when such elements govern the approach to the green the golfing merits of the 
course are infinitely superior to those on course where every approach is over flat surface love that 
quote And used it in my hole by hole account telling the story of the sixth It seems to me the strategy of 
the sixth hole which is yards long was to drive down the extreme right side of the fairway when the hole 
was cut at back left behind the mound in order to avoid having to play over it Of course that type of 
heady play was particularly important in the day prior to fairway irrigation Conversely when the hole 
was cut at far right on the sixth green next to greenside bunker there driving down the extreme left side 
of the fairway was advisable This type of strategy is very typical of Donald Ross architecture green that 
necessitates completely different strategy off the tee depending on the location of the hole day to day 
That description of the sixth tells the story well But the yard sixteenth is probably an even better 
example The sixteenth in my opinion was the most strategic hole at Essex in the early days Today it 
might the most one dimensional following seven decades of evolution and bit of redesign Donald Ross 
rarely promoted defensive play off the tee Thus nearly all of the fairways at Essex were planned to be at 
least yards wide Such wide berths actually created sense of false security because simply driving into the 
short grass often wasn good enough Like the Essex sixth and so many other great Ross designed holes 
the strategy at sixteen was dictated by the hole location on any given day There used to be distinct lobe 
of green surface that jutted between greenside bunkers at right that was most easily approachable from 
the extreme left side of the fairway particularly before they started watering the fairways regularly 
when you really had to bounce the ball onto the greens Holes cut atop high shelf at back left of the 
sixteenth green on the other hand are more accessible from the right side of the fairway Again the 
location of the hole necessitated completely different line of play off the tee day to day Ross wanted 
golfers to think their way around the course to play angles tacking their way strategically to the hole 
These days though the only thought on Essex sixteenth tee is better hit it straight There nothing else to 
consider because there really only one line to drive on The fairway was shifted left and narrowed to 
about yards across in when group of three bunkers were installed some yards out on the right As per 
Ross original drawn plan the sixteenth fairway was intended to be yards wide As result it very awkward 
situation nowadays Overhanging limbs on the left side of the fairway short distance off the tee that 
suggest draw But then you look down the hole toward the green and the fairway pattern and bunkers 
make you think fade Then you give your head shake wise up and see there only one shot straight 
between the overhanging limbs on the left and the bunkers on the right Don even think about trying to 
bend the ball Some golfers argue that such situation adds to the challenge The problem is it very very un 
Ross like to demand specific shot trajectory and line off the tee Organizing the book was relatively 
simple because the club has basically been through three distinct eras on three different sites It was 
established in as Oak Ridge Golf Club then moved from its original site in when it became Essex County 
Golf Country Club following an amalgamation with Walkerville Country Club Nineteen years later Essex 
moved to its present day site The first three main sections of the book detail those specific eras 
individually Then of course there comprehensive section on the golf course which includes biographies 
on Donald Ross and John Gray who supervised construction of the course and stayed on as the club 
green keeper until his sudden death in There hole by hole section as well and chapter titled The 
Evolution of the Golf Course which details all of the changes to the course since it opened for play in July 
And Bruce Hepner was kind enough to contribute an interesting essay on Ross and the Essex course 
which concludes that section also included short chapter on Roseland city owned course in Windsor that 
was laid out by Ross in ve since been asked why included chapter on municipal course in book about the 
history of Essex Golf Country Club Well for one it always been interesting to me that of the courses 
throughout North America that Ross is credited with working on only or so are in Canada and that of 
those two are in Windsor lot of Essex members grew up playing Roseland too And no one had 
documented any history of the course which feel is somewhat taken for granted It real gem with great 
variety of holes and some excellent greens If it were polished up bit think Roseland might very well be 
the best muni in the country thought the Essex book provided good opportunity to shed some light on 
its heritage and genius Next there section titled Champions Championships which includes biographies 
of Essex most accomplished golfers and recaps of the major tournaments hosted by the club over the 
years including the Canadian Open Jerry Pate won that Open only few weeks after his US Open victory at 
Atlanta Athletic Club The sports writers dubbed him King of the Continent Pate was nice enough to write 
letter for the book recalling his experience at Essex as were Ben Crenshaw Jim Nelford Brandie Burton 
and Tom Jenkins who won the Canadian Senior Open at Essex in Crenshaw played with Pate in the final 
group on Sunday in He still says Pate that day was the best ball striking round he ever witnessed The 
book concludes with biographies on the club professionals including the fascinating story of Jock Burns 
While researching the book tracked down his son Stan who still lives in Windsor and was shocked to 
learn that Burns came over from St Andrews Scotland in the spring of specifically to become the pro at 
Essex Even more amazing though is that his father Jack Burns won the Open Championship at the Old 
Course Sadly most people had forgotten about this fact It was thrill for me to include that story in the 
book also have to express my gratitude to Lorne Rubenstein for contributing Foreword to the book 
Lorne an admirer of Essex and probably the most well respected Canadian golf writer ever His 
involvement lends significant credibility to my effort can believe how many books ve seen on the history 
of clubs with some pretty good golf courses that don even include hole by hole account which is 
unfortunate And many others that do simply describe the holes as they look and play in the present 
used the hole by hole section in the Essex book to also explain Ross original strategies and to detail the 
evolution of the holes That part of the club history after all And as mentioned above there also separate 
chapter titled The Evolution of the Golf Course too that chronicles all of the changes to the course over 
the years and details the restorative based plans devised by Bruce Hepner think comprehensive account 
of the golf course evolution is important to include which takes lot of time and research and also bit of 
gentleness mean it very important that the text doesn come across as blatant criticism of past 
committeemen golf architects and course superintendents who made ill advised changes to the course 
over the years In order to avoid that used quotes from Donald Ross Bruce Hepner and other authorities 
like Ross biographer Brad Klein wherever could so that my writing couldn be deemed Jeff opinion or 
accused of being politically motivated as it easily could have in case like mine when club member is 
writing the history Historic aerials are also crucial We concluded the chapter on the evolution of the 
course with two page spread featuring aerial of Essex at left and aerial of the course at right Fifty eight 
pages of text on the history and evolution of the golf course don tell its story as well as comparison 
between those two photos Although there have been very few physical changes made to the course 
over the years those two aerials illustrate just how much has changed nonetheless Historic aerials are 
invaluable in regard to tracing the evolution of an old course and also understanding its original design 
After all it wasn uncommon during the and for in the field alterations to be made to original concepts as 
construction progressed and previously unforeseen opportunities presented themselves So even if you 
have an architect drawn plans you can be absolutely certain how the course was actually built without 
an early aerial There are number of fairway bunkers that appear in the aerial of Essex for example that 
don appear on Ross drawings and vice versa There are other bunkers on the drawings that don appear in 
the aerial If you can track down one aerial from each decade in course history chronological comparison 
between those photos will tell an interesting tale aerial of EssexA aerial of Essex Note in particular the 
creation of the lake in the upper left corner of the photograph as well as how the fairway width has 
been reduced to the point where the bunkers are now outside of the fairway That aerial dispelled the 
widely held belief that Essex has always been heavily treed course think more than few members who 
actually believe the brilliance of the golf course is attributable to its abundance of trees were quite 
surprised to see the original barren nature of the back nine in particular as it appears in that photo 
While it true the front nine was cut through forested area the incoming holes were built on open 
farmland and remained that way for at least years until arbitrary planting started in the mid to late as it 
did elsewhere One of favourite stories from the book is about the area comprised of holes through 
which was so open that past club president Walter Bartlet landed his recreational airplane on the th 
fairway during the early These days the th fairway is about yards wide bordered by trees on the right 
and pond installed in as means to increase irrigation water storage capacity at left You couldn land plane 
there today even if you were crazy enough to try was lucky to have Dick Carr as partner on the project 
Dick been an Essex member since and is past president of the club He also history buff who had been 
collecting anything and everything relative to Essex history since before was born He helped put 
together small soft cover booklet on the history of the club back in which was sort of the foundation of 
our project Karen Hewson and Sarah Patton at the Royal Canadian Golf Association museum were also 
very helpful The RCGA has back issues of Canadian Golfer magazine from the and that were catalogued 
by my friend Jim Barclay while he was serving as the museum honorary curator during the mid Jim made 
wonderful book Golf in Canada History after going through all of that stuff And his efforts in that regard 
have made it comparatively simple to research the history of golf in Canada these days Canadian Golfer 
magazine provided comprehensive coverage of the goings on in golf throughout Canada during the pre 
World War II era Khristine Januzik at the Tufts Archive in Pinehurst NC was always encouraging and 
more than willing to help me dig around down there where we found Ross original plans for both Essex 
and Roseland And it was fascinating to meet and talk with people like Stan Burns and John Gray son Lyle 
about the lives their fathers lived through golf tracked down Lyle Gray in the San Francisco area few 
years ago and subsequently came to learn that his father had worked briefly with golf architect Charles 
Alison in the Chicago area and at Country Club of Detroit before settling down as Essex green keeper 
Gray was also the first Canadian green keeper to serve as president of the National Green keepers 
Association which is the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America today Gray was another 
story that was thrilled to include in the book was anxious to find routing plan for the Essex first course 
on the club second site or at least to try put one together based on the recollections of few old timers 
who had played their as young kids But that proved to be impossible That course was called the Prince 
Farm course and it was laid out by Ernest Way in shortly after he had finished supervising construction 
of Donald Ross two courses at Detroit Golf Club Way was the pro green keeper there at Detroit for many 
years We also couldn find single historic ground level photo of Essex present day course either which 
was very disappointing The oldest photo we have is shot of the th green taken just before the Canadian 
Open in There was clubhouse fire during the mid that reportedly destroyed lot of old records and 
photographs Presumably few old shots of the golf course were victims of the fire And was also hoping to 
find an earlier aerial of the course too Like something from the early People at the National Air Photo 
Library in Ottawa told me very few aerial photos were taken in Canada prior to the Second World War 
which explains why the earliest aerial of Essex we ve been able to find is that one from There another 
interesting story about guy in the Toronto area who claimed he has moving picture taken at Essex in or 
during construction of the course Reportedly he said the only way he ll turn it over to the club is if buddy 
of his who lives in Windsor is made an honorary member Club directors declined that deal few years ago 
so no one knows for sure if this movie actually exists What historical treasure it might be though 
particularly if Donald Ross appears on film understand there only been one other movie found to date 
that features Ross taken during the construction of Aronimink near Philadelphia about Working on 
history book of any kind think there always stuff you wish would have been uncovered But it gets to the 
point when you have to go to print No doubt about it Studying Essex history and evolution really 
sparked an interest in how golf courses evolve and the potential for restoration Then as traveled more 
and more visiting other courses of similar age was continually amazed that nearly every one of them had 
evolved negatively in similar fashion to Essex principally through proliferation of trees and significant 
loss of fairway acreage and green surface area Moreover it seemed most golfers were very proud of 
their home course design heritage Yet at the same time few clearly realized how much those aged 
courses had changed over more than half century Evolutionary changes occur very slowly So the basic 
intent of the new book is to help golfers understand how golf course typically evolves how to keep any 
negative evolution in check and also to explain how any unwanted changes that have already resulted 
from natural evolution the adverse affects of everyday play and maintenance or blatant redesign can be 
reversed And of course why we all should want to do just that when it comes to the consistently brilliant 
work of Donald Ross and his contemporaries Please email Jeff at JeMingay aol com if you are interested

guidesBarnwell All Trades Mock dealsPicking potential draft sleepersMore NFL draft coverage Acquire 
the quarterback of the future This could have easily been vote for adding more explosive options for 
Tom Brady because that equally important But in the big picture there is one to four year window for 
the Patriots to discover and develop the quarterback who could eventually take the reins from Brady 
New England is operating with some margin for error because the year old Brady is still capable of 
leading team to the Super Bowl and he has said he committed to playing in and beyond The draft is the 
most likely avenue to fill this need with the hope that Jimmy Garoppolo might be available Mike 
ReissFind new head coach The Jets took care of the quarterback issue last offseason but now they need 
someone who can lead Sam Darnold and the rest of the team back to relevancy The losing culture must 
be eradicated and it will take strong personality to accomplish that Ideally they can find coach with 
history of developing quarterbacks because Darnold is the key to the future Rich CiminiAdd playmaker 
on offense The Ravens produced plays of yards or more which ranked th in the NFL Baltimore has to add 
more explosive talent around Lamar Jackson whether it young wide receiver or dynamic running back 
The Ravens can count on marching down the field on and play drives Baltimore needs someone to 
generate chunk plays and take pressure off its new franchise quarterback Jamison HensleyUpgrade at 
linebacker The offensive line needs an upgrade as well but the linebacker play was among the worst in 
the league this season and that showed against high powered offenses like the Saints and Chiefs The 
Bengals need to make drafting linebacker priority It clear that Vontaze Burfict can no longer be relied 
upon and middle linebacker Preston Brown didn get to show much due to injuries The entire group 
needs to be overhauled in Katherine TerrellAdd another impact defender Whether it run stuffing 
defensive tackle the Browns ranked th in rushing defense to go with Larry Ogunjobi or an impact 
linebacker Cleveland needs defender who can change game Adding one more piece to what is already 
on the defense helps the team Close second big play wide receiver to give Baker Mayfield more help Pat 
McManamonTim Hasselbeck and Ryan Clark weigh in on whether Andy Reid and the Chiefs can get it 
done in the postseason Solve the Antonio Brown situation The Steelers must decide whether to keep 
Brown or find willing trade partner before his million roster bonus is due March Despite Brown 
greatness the team seems to be over his antics making his million salary cap number expendable Getting 
high pick in return will be crucial in trying to replace Brown so expect the Steelers to hold out closer to 
mid March Jeremy FowlerImprove the offensive line The Texans need to make the line an offseason 
priority after third round pick Martinas Rankin was the only significant addition to their front in 
Quarterback Deshaun Watson was sacked times and under constant duress all season Not all of the 
sacks were the fault of the offensive line but Watson needs more time to stand in the pocket so 
DeAndre Hopkins and healthy Will Fuller can make plays down the field Turron DavenportBring in pass 
rusher The Colts had one of the NFL most surprising units this season finishing th in total defense and 
had the league leading tackler in Darius Leonard but didn have player reach double digits in sacks Pairing 
an elite pass rusher with Leonard and the rest of the team young defenders will help the Colts take 
another step defensively next season Mike WellsSolve the quarterback dilemma The Jaguars will likely 
start fresh after making the decision to move on from Blake Bortles That could be signing free agent 
such as Tyrod Taylor or Ryan Fitzpatrick or potentially Nick Foles going the aging veteran route with Eli 
Manning or Joe Flacco or drafting quarterback in the first round The price for Foles likely skyrocketed 
after the wild card games and the Jaguars might have to part with more than they would like if they 
were to try to trade up in the draft from the No spot Execs Tom Coughlin and Dave Caldwell and head 
coach Doug Marrone will have to decide if they re willing to give away part of their future draft capital to 
end up with the quarterback they believe will get them back into the playoffs in Mike DiRoccoBring in an 
impact pass rusher The Titans fielded one of the best league scoring defenses this season despite 
registering only sacks Rookie outside linebacker Harold Landry has promising future and will begin to see 
double teams so the Titans need to get an edge rusher who can consistently beat one on one matchups 
on the opposite side Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jurrell Casey is an established player who needs 
someone to help him collapse the pocket from the interior Turron DavenportConstruct plan at 
quarterback Case Keenum has just one year remaining on his contract and the Broncos have no 
quarterback they drafted on their roster so that puts them in the growing crowd of teams looking for 
long term solution The coaching change likely means the team will line up with its fourth different 
playbook on offense in four season span It is difficult to consistently find the right personnel if the team 
is constantly cycling through playcallers Jeff LegwoldRebuild the secondary It reasonable to believe that 
of all of the defensive backs who played for the Chiefs this season only cornerback Kendall Fuller might 
remain by The Chiefs need some long term solutions at both safety and corner and the time to get 
started on that is now with the Chiefs holding three picks in the first two rounds of the draft Adam 
TeicherEverything you need this weekplayoffs coverageFull schedule Full standingsdraft order Every first 
round pickMore NFL coverage Acquire depth at linebacker With Denzel Perryman Jatavis Brown and 
Kyzir White out for the season due to injuries the Chargers are thin at linebacker and should look to add 
depth to that position group either through the draft or free agency The Chargers have done nice job of 
making up for the lack up healthy bodies by playing safeties Adrian Phillips and Jahleel Addae at 
linebacker with good results however needs bigger bodies at the second level for defensive coordinator 
Gus Bradley Cover scheme to be most effective Eric WilliamsFind home for Sure we know the Raiders 
plan on playing in Las Vegas in but with no lease for home stadium for next season the Raiders are 
literally in Parts Unknown even as they have been linked to San Francisco San Diego Reno Nevada Santa 
Clara California London and yes even Oakland The NFL wants to know by early February at the latest 
where the Raiders plan to call home and you can bet that free agents also would like to know where the 
Raiders will be playing this fall before signing with the franchise Tick tock Paul GutierrezMaximize Dak 
Prescott skill set It not that the Cowboys have not made an effort to play to Prescott strengths but can 
they do more The only quarterback to win more games the past three seasons has been Tom Brady 
Prescott will not challenge the passing leaders in the league especially with Ezekiel Elliott success on the 
ground but the Cowboys can do more with Prescott on the move and getting him on the run No team 
would want to expose its quarterback too many times to big hits but Prescott knows how to take care of 
himself on the field Jerry Jones has said the Cowboys need to be Dak friendly but he was talking mostly 
about personnel They don need to completely change their offense but they need to be more Dak 
friendly in terms of using his skill set Todd ArcherStart the search for franchise quarterback It the most 
important position on any team and the Giants need to set in motion plan to succeed Eli Manning All 
these weapons will mean nothing if they don find quarterback sooner rather than later whether it be via 
the draft free agency or trade Manning is and might not even return for Kyle Lauletta is fourth round 
pick who was buried on the depth chart as rookie The draft appears to be the Giants best avenue to 
Manning long term successor They have the No overall pick and none of the five teams ahead of them is 
likely in the QB market Jordan RaananThe NFL Live crew breaks down the drama surrounding Antonio 
Brown and the Steelers and whether he ll be traded this offseason Add edge rushers The Eagles could 
use speed receiver and running back but this team strength is derived from the offensive and defensive 
fronts With defensive end Brandon Graham set to become free agent the Eagles need to either find way 
to re sign him or sign veteran who can help fill the void Tim McManusFind quarterback again There 
uncertainty surrounding Alex Smith future because of the compound spiral fracture in his right leg and it 
could be some time before the Redskins and Smith know if or when he might return Washington must 
plan for life without him but the question is how Smith contract makes it difficult because he count 
more than million in dead money if cut this offseason the Redskins have only around million in cap space 
now Their options include signing or trading for another veteran quarterback but they ll have to be 
creative They could draft one to team with Colt McCoy and possibly Josh Johnson though it not 
considered strong or deep draft class Still if there quarterback they like they need to pounce The 
Redskins expect to have nine picks after the compensatory selections are announced so they ll have 
options Coach Jay Gruden remains confident in McCoy but the veteran backup must prove he can stay 
healthy and also that he can reward that confidence John KeimSign reliable kicker The Bears probably 
can keep Cody Parkey even if they wanted to after he missed the game winner in Chicago playoff loss to 
the Eagles He missed total kicks this season after the Bears signed him to four year deal that included 
million in guaranteed money The Bears have struggled at kicker ever since they released the franchise all 
time leading scorer Robbie Gould who coincidentally will be free agent after making of field goals over 
the past three seasons for the Giants and ers Jeff DickersonAcquire star pass rusher The Lions need 
better pressure against opposing quarterbacks and with Ezekiel Ansah unlikely to return next season this 
becomes their No need much like it was season ago even when the team had Ansah They ll have 
multiple options to fix it either through free agency or the draft where pass rushers are plentiful in this 
class If Detroit wants to build stellar defense that the biggest hole to fill Michael RothsteinGet Aaron 
Rodgers to buy in to what new coach Matt LaFleur brings in Hiring the head coach was just the first part 
of the solution Now it up to the offense minded LaFleur to mesh with Rodgers LaFleur has built in 
credibility working with Matt Ryan and Jared Goff two quarterbacks whom Rodgers respects so that 
should help Rob DemovskyAddress the offensive line The same storyline that haunted the Vikings 
throughout is one that remains the top priority this offseason After surrendering league high pressures 
Minnesota needs to upgrade the offensive line particularly its guard spots It wouldn be surprise to see 
the Vikings completely overhaul the line and move on from the likes of Tom Compton Mike Remmers 
who has no guaranteed money left on his deal Brett Jones Danny Isidora and Rashod Hill Minnesota has 
several ways it can create the cap space needed to go after lineman or two in free agency but it also 
needs to use chunk of its draft capital in the higher rounds to begin to fix the problem Courtney 
CroninHire an offensive coordinator to get the most out of the team weapons The Falcons need to find 
seasoned coordinator to pair with Matt Ryan Julio Jones Co Former Tampa Bay coach Dirk Koetter who 
previously served as Atlanta offensive coordinator appears to be the top choice after interviewing 
Saturday Koetter knows how to play to Ryan strengths and bring his playcalling expertise to the zone 
scheme head coach Dan Quinn wants to keep in place Once the coordinator is hired the Falcons can 
focus on beefing up the three spots on the offensive line outside of center and left tackle Vaughn

coverage Acquire and develop backup quarterback If this question had been asked in early December an 
edge rusher would have been the easy answer But with quarterback Cam Newton being shut down for 
the final two games because of sore right shoulder that has limited him in practice much of the past two 
seasons backup quarterback who could replace Newton has to move to the top of the list An edge 
rusher still is important this defense thrives off pressure from the front four and it didn get that 
consistently this season But Newton shoulder makes reliable backup even more of priority David 
NewtonBuild up depth at tight end This was an area of need even before veteran starter Benjamin 
Watson announced he is retiring at the end of the season The Saints need depth at the position and they 
could especially use another reliable pass catcher to go with receivers Michael Thomas and Ted Ginn Jr 
and running back Alvin Kamara It should be draft priority but it might be big enough need to address it in 
free agency especially since the Saints don have first or third round pick this year Mike TriplettHire 
coach to solve the Bucs issues In week since firing Dirk Koetter the Bucs interviewed four candidates Eric 
Bieniemy George Edwards Bruce Arians and Kris Richard Who can get Jameis Winston on the right track 
and best relate to the year old quarterback Who can resuscitate defense that showed signs of life after 
Mike Smith firing but still has major work to do Who can restore order in locker room where according 
to Jason Pierre Paul players didn keep it real with each other Jenna LaineUpdate The Bucs are finalizing 
deal to make Bruce Arians their next coach Find the right head coach For multitude of reasons Steve 
Wilks didn work out going in his only season with the team before getting fired Dec This time around the 
Cardinals need to get it right Not only have they missed the playoffs the past three seasons they have 
seen their roster depth diminished and now have the No overall pick in the draft They do have young 
quarterback to build around in Josh Rosen Cardinals execs said over and over during their end of season 
news conference that they were going to keep their search close to the vest As reports of interviews 
trickle out however it clear Arizona is focused on finding an offense minded coach which should 
immediately help Rosen blossom in Year Josh WeinfussUpdate The Cardinals hired former Texas Tech 
coach Kliff Kingsbury on Tuesday Acquire an edge rusher The Rams added Dante Fowler Jr in midseason 
trade with the Jaguars but he free agent this offseason solid edge rusher is crucial to the success of 
defensive coordinator Wade Phillips scheme Before the addition of Fowler the Rams were unable to 
consistently apply pressure from the edge Lindsey ThiryAdd an elite edge rusher The ers have tried to 
add an outside complement to DeForest Buckner since Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch arrived but they 
haven had the spot in the draft to select one and the top outside rushers haven hit the free agent 
market An attempt to trade for Khalil Mack also came up just short The Niners know what top outside 
pass rusher could do for their defense and they ll explore every avenue especially with the No overall 
pick to make it happen Nick WagonerContinue to build up the defense The Seahawks have handful of 
young building blocks and still have an All Pro middle linebacker in Bobby Wagner but there are holes to 
be filled Seattle No ranking in yards allowed per rush and No ranking in yards allowed per pass attempt 
highlight the needs for another run stuffer to play alongside Jarran Reed another edge player to 
complement Frank Clark and perhaps an upgrade at safety to team with Bradley McDougald assuming 
Earl Thomas isn back The Seahawks also will need to determine how much linebacker Wright an 
impending free agent can continue to be an impact player with his troublesome knee Brady

President resigned two weeks ago which caused SLRFU interventionCale Yarborough was back to his old 
self fast and feisty strutting around the Daytona International Speedway garage Wednesday after 
capturing the pole position for the Firecracker It looked like old times again for Yarborough who set 
Firecracker qualifying record by traveling mph in his Ford Thunderbird leading pack of drivers past the 
mph mark Yarborough has won record pole positions at Daytona but this was his first anywhere since 
Although he achieved much of his fame through the years by blistering this track at record speeds his 
dominance here seemed finished in replaced by faster Bill Elliott Elliott who had won the past three pole 
positions at Daytona and previously held the Firecracker record finished very close second at mph He 
also drove Ford Thunderbird With the way things have been going this one is especially meaningful 
Yarborough said When you re accustomed to winning like am second is not easy to take By Yarborough 
standards this season has been poor one His best finishes have been third at the Charlotte and the 
Pocono In eight starts this season he has finished nd or worse five times His team also received serious 
disruption last month when crew chief and engine builder Waddell Wilson announced he was leaving 
the team after the season to join Hendrick Motorsports which also has secured Darrell Waltrip as driver 
for Wednesday Yarborough indicated his driving status for next season is uncertain Wilson like 
Yarborough was considered the master at Daytona qualifying until last season This was the ninth time 
he has been the crew chief for the fastest qualifier here The slump he and Yarborough were in coincided 
with the team switch from Chevrolet to Ford at the start of This was Yarborough first pole since the 
switch The transition took much longer than anyone thought We ve had so much bad luck that maybe 
we re due for good second half Maybe this is the start of things to come Yarborough said And with 
things happening the way they are Waddell leaving our poor finishes this couldn come at better time 
Although Yarborough time was well off Elliott track record of mph set in last year Daytona qualifying the 
overall times were considered exceptionally fast considering the summer heat which reached degrees 
during morning qualifying During last year qualifying only Yarborough and Elliott passed mph This year 
there were number of surprisingly fast times Buddy Baker who hasn won race since the Firecracker 
qualified third at mph Benny Parsons who has won only one race since qualified fourth at Both were 
driving Oldsmobiles Winston Cup points leader Dale Earnhardt was fifth at mph in Chevrolet and Bobby 
Allison drove mph for sixth in Buick ready to race Let go Earnhardt said can run that fast all day My car 
felt real good at that speed Earnhardt who has won three races this season nearly swept the races here 
in February He won the Busch Clash and his mile qualifier but his engine failed with three laps left in the 
Daytona preventing clean sweep The top times Wednesday qualified for Friday race Those that didn will 
have another chance this morning at Among those who failed to qualify Wednesday were Joe Ruttman 
mph Ricky Rudd mph defending champion Greg Sacks mph Harry Gant mph and Waltrip mph ve gone 
eight races this year without win Yarborough said If can win the next eight races ll be happy That not too 
much to askThe Kickstarter program helps your Pre child develop love for the game of soccer Our

highlights Packers headlines Packers focus on rushing defense In the the halfway point of the season the 
Pittsburgh Steelers have the No rushing defense in the NFL allowing yards per game At the end of that 
top spot belonged to Green Bay which held opponents to an average of yards per game But the Packers 
aren anywhere close to that now Their rushing defense has fallen all the way to th at Injuries and 
circumstances have led to the indication at least statistically of defensive drop off But despite the 
numbers the Packers still feel they have very good run defense and point to the shutout against New 
York Coach McCarthy believes in the run defense and great opportunity to improve in the second half of 
the season Against the Jets the defensive line and supporting outside linebackers helped dictate the 
down and distance said Capers Cowboys scouting report Running game Cowboys have been major 
disappointment The Cowboys rank No in the NFL in rushing yards per game Their backfield tandem 
should be good Marion Barber is which is before the decline starts for most NFL backs and Jones is but 
they re not picking up anything Barber the nominal starter has been reduced to mainly short yardage 
back and is averaging only yards on his carries Jones has decent yard average in his carries but he hasn 
been the breakaway threat of past years On the offensive line LT Free has been fine but the rest of the 
group hasn Passing game Romo is out The Cowboys will miss his ability to make plays especially when 
things break down and he moves outside the pocket Backup Jon Kitna is stationary target He has decent 
and relatively accurate throwing arm but he not playmaker Running defense Dallas collapse on defense 
is the biggest surprise of its season The Cowboys finished last season with the No rushing defense and 
No scoring defense but have dropped to Nos and respectively this year Passing defense The most 
damning statistic of bad year Jacksonville QB Garrard hitting the Cowboys for four touchdown passes 
and an astronomical passer rating Though the Cowboys rank No in the NFL in sacks percentage the pass 
rush hasn been lacking Special teams Bryant is big time threat returning punts and has taken back two of 
his returns for touchdowns Rookie kickoff returner Akwasi Owusu Ansah yard average hasn been as 
dynamic Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers talks about team renewed confidence There was different 
feeling in the locker room Rodgers said in an interview on the Jim Rome radio show That confidence was 
back There was an excitement The urgency from the previous week carried over The guys we ve brought 
in have all had the right mindset They ve been hungry Rodgers said We brought in DE Green He played 
great for us Charles Peprah been starting at safety and had great game Sunday It combination of the 
guys filling those voids improving their play and good leadership keeping the guys focused on the things 
that we can control Rodgers also discussed an offense that continues to struggle The Packers rank No in 
the NFL in average yards No in points game and tied for No on third downs percent Offensively we can 
do lot more Rodgers said We ve been hurt by some injuries obviously to couple key players We still feel 
like we haven made enough plays on offense and that starts with me ve got to play better in the second 
half of the seasonComments are closedThe Cave ofDragonflies forumstcod asb on GitHubTCoD ASBdb by

Netgalley but have no idea why am not interested in sports guessing it was the cover managed to get 
through this one despite myself It was touch and go there for bit not even going to attempt to pretend 
otherwise Only my laziness to figure out what wanted to read next kept me going One of these days will 
learn how to DNF correctly Chase is rich and famous hockey star and has reputation as being the bad 
boy of hockey because he trouble maker on the ice and he likes to sleep with women Ummm ok He 
young he loaded and he beautiful say that pretty normal not bad but what do know He is secretly in love 
with his best friend Cassie but he knows he can never share his feelings because it will destroy their 
close friendship Thus all the sleeping around with the hockey bunnies After Chase scares off Cassie latest 
date in real jerky alpha move she laughs it off and calls him an asshole but she is relieved She is focused 
on her career and moving on up and isn seriously pursuing relationship She much rather hang out with 
Chase and his friends than some random boring guy anyway And when your best friend is hockey god 
normal guys don stand chance My description is making this sound dreadful know that and it not At 
least not yet Cassie is chosen to make key note speech and present huge rollout for her company This is 
BIG deal for Cassie It takes weeks of preparation and will help her reach her goals The trip is in Vegas 
She decides to take Chase with her and it here that the story goes all to hell for me won spoil it for 
everyone dying to read it but will say that some colossally idiotic behavior goes down and Cassie ends up 
looking like complete idiot when it was all said and done You might be able to get past that and forget 
about it Not She is only at the time you might say but at already had two kids mortgage and full time job 
and was well on the way to becoming the grumpy reader am today is old enough to know better than to 
act like coed on spring break Cassie up until Vegas was painted as responsible intelligent woman so none 
of this made sense This Vegas nonsense tainted the rest of the story for me because after Vegas 
happened didn give any craps about her and her relationship with Chase That better So as mentioned 
did carry on after taking little break and few deep cleansing breaths What followed wasn really worth 
the effort Their sexy times were hot ll give them that but that not enough to carry me through book like 
this when their thoughts and self talk are repetitive and tedious Chase describes Cassie as hilarious but 
never saw it which is crying shame Telling me someone is hilarious does me no good at all when they 
come across as average to boring on the page They say love is blind though and do believe it is true Ah 
well perhaps just too grouchy for this kind of book This heroine just did something so incredibly stupid 
and out of character that don give damn what happens to her and her lover boy now Such dum dum 
cannot stand it Bad Reputation grabs the reader attention pretty quickly as characters are introduced 
and we learn about the friendship between Chase and Cassie The characters are interesting and the 
dialogue is often witty and fun While Chase is bad boy on the ice wouldn necessarily call him that when 
it comes to romance playboy yes but that doesn make him bad boy His best friend who according to the 
blurb calls him on his BS even mentions what great guy he is and how well he treats women That aside 
the story is engaging at the beginning but begins to fizzle soon thereafter The pacing is almost 
agonizingly slow at times and found myself wondering if there was actually going to be any romance 
Things do start to heat up between Cassie and Chase but the turnaround in Cassie behavior seemed bit 
much considering how career driven she is up to that point The writer is certainly talented and the 
premise is good but the pacing made it too easy to set aside for something else Chase Barrett and Cassie 
Desrosiers are best friends and have been since college They have NEVER crossed that line because they 
value their friendship too much but lately they both have been secretly wondering what if Cassie is an 
executive VP for an IT company and has been selected to be the keynote speaker at the big Technology 
conference in Las Vegas NV to talk about her company new app she is in charge of launching Chase is 
the bad boy of hockey and even has the nickname of Sin both on and off the court Of course the only 
person who can put Chase in his place is Cassie After losing their game that would have put them into 
the playoffs Chase heads to Cassie place for some cheering up He not happy when he realizes some guy 
is already at her place Chase lets himself into Cassie place and that when the fun begins This scene was 
so LOL funny One thing leads to another and all of sudden Chase is going to go with Cassie to Vegas 
While in Las Vegas Chase and Cassie get completely drunk and have the attitude what happens in Vegas 
stays in Vegas As most people know that is never the case Now they both must figure out what is 
happening and where they should from there loved Chase He was so fun and cocky and such dirty talker 
Cassie is fun and sweet and the responsible one The journey these two went on to get to their happy 
ending was fun adventurous and emotional laughed cried and swooned really enjoyed this friends to 
lovers story Cassie and Chase have been best friends since college There has never been anything 
romantic between them Not until crazy night in Vegas Then it all changes Chase has always been 
interested in Cassie As best friend and as woman She thinks he is with all these other women but he is 
not No one can hold candle to Cassie If they can overcome an assumption that is incorrect maybe there 
is chance at bright future This was such lovely and hot story So intense but really fun always love best 
friends stories married mine after all The heat and friendship in this book are very much worth the read 
cannot wait to read the next book in the Bad Boys of Sports series give this story Kitty Paws UP This ARC

JaneAug This confluence point was visited while we were on holiday travelling from Perth to Cairns then 
back to Perth via the Gulf and the Kimberley Four visits were planned for this trip and This confluence 
point is on the border between Queensland and the Northern Territory and is on the property of 
Wollogorang Station had contacted the station owner prior to leaving Perth seeking his permission to 
traverse Wollogorang in order to visit the confluence point but did not hear back from him On the day 
that the visit was planned we drove into Wollogorang and fortunately the owner Stuart Zlotkowski was 
at home After receiving an explanation and clarification of our intentions he gave us his permission to 
proceed and provided instructions for reaching the target point We are grateful to him for this Sarah 
Jane and drove from the homestead km north along dusty station track which as planned took us to 
within of the point From there it was short and easy walk through reasonably dense savannah scrub to 
the confluence point few metres west of which large wallaby was waiting for us See photograph After 
taking the prescribed photographs the return to the homestead and exiting the station and back to the 
main road were straightforward and uneventfulGenuine Be Nice HalterAs featured in Leading and 
Loading by Kelly MarksThe Be Nice Halter is an excellent and humane training device imported from 
America The design is patented and although there have been some imitations manufactured nothing 
else is as effective The Be Nice often succeeds where the Dually Chifney Kempton and other halters fail 
Please note our sizes are normal UK sizes and are not tag sizes as these are generally too small Why the 
Be Nice Halter Ideal for control for many situations The Be Nice has no sharp parts and will not dig in like 
makeshift chain or rope It will not damage the sensitive mouth like chifney It is easy to use with no knots 
to tie The halter works on the simple principle that when the horse resists pressure is automatically 
applied and when the animal begins to co operate the pressure is automatically and instantly released 
The Be Nice Halter is constructed from braid on braid nylon dacron rope The rings and side buckle are 
made of cast bronze The slide is of high tensile moulded nylon all high quality and good workmanship 
that you would expect from training halterDon forget never tie up and leave unattended or turn out in

Contact usCopyright Grey SocialAll Rights Reserved Coincide with International Day of Mine Awareness 
and Assistance in Mine Action Grey for Good the philanthropic arm of Grey Group Singapore has teamed 
up with DanChurchAid DCA to drive support for creating safer communities in post conflict zones around 
the world communities free of dangerous remnants of war such as land mines unexploded ammunition 
and cluster bombs It is pressing topic often described as one of the most evil problems affecting millions 
of civilians in over countries around the world And it takes mammoth effort to tackle However the topic 
does not feature lot in the public conversation or the media other imminent issues get all the coverage 
To change this the team has developed an integrated campaign that builds an emotional link to one of 
the world biggest sports football It universal sport and is played on streets fields playgrounds parking 
lots and many more places But due to remnants of war such as land mines cluster bombs and 
unexploded ammunition in large parts of the world playing football on fields can be extremely 
dangerous especially for children Introducing ClearThePitch campaign which links the global love for 
football with the aim of creating greater awareness and support for the essential work of making 
communities in post conflict zones safer to live Hopefully taking the topic out of its humanitarian niche 
back into the popular culture limelight Driving not just awareness but also donations for an organization 
that is making tangible difference in communities around the world The theme of football is everything 
but random It allows us to reach and involve huge group of people not just millions of fans but also the 
clubs players associations and potentially even the sponsors With surprising but actually hard hitting link 
for millions of children playing the sport we all love is extremely dangerous Our hope is to capture the 
imagination of the world of football to give the topic and our partner DCA both the visibility and the 
financial support that are so urgently needed said Till Hohmann Executive Creative Director Vice 
President GSK Grey Group Singapore Richard MacCormac DCA Head of Mine Action Together with Grey 
for Good we look forward to driving an impact on this issue The goal is not only creating safe football 
pitches for children but to also provide safe and secure living conditions for families and communities so 
they can live normal life To watch the film and learn more about this issue go to this website
